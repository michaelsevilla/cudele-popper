  note = {This book is for anyone who wants to support computer peripherals under the Linux operating system or who wants to develop new hardware and run it under Linux. Linux is the fastest-growing segment of the Unix market, is winning over enthusiastic adherents in many application areas, and is being viewed more and more as a good platform for embedded systems. *Linux Device Drivers,* already a classic in its second edition, reveals information that heretofore has been shared by word of mouth or in cryptic source code comments, on how to write drivers for a wide range of devices. Version 2.4 of the Linux kernel includes significant changes to device drivers, simplifying many activities, but providing subtle new features that can make a driver both more efficient and more flexible. The second edition of this book thoroughly covers these changes, as well as new processors and buses. You don't have to be a kernel hacker to understand and enjoy this book; all you need is an understanding of C and some background in Unix system calls. You'll learn how to write drivers for character devices, block devices, and network interfaces, guided by full-featured examples that you can compile and run without special hardware. Major changes in the second edition include discussions of symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and locking, new CPUs, and recently supported buses. For those who are curious about how an operating system does its job, this book provides insights into address spaces, asynchronous events, and I/O. Portability is a major concern in the text. The book is centered on version 2.4, but includes information for kernels back to 2.0 where feasible. *Linux Device Driver* also shows how to maximize portability among hardware platforms; examples were tested on IA32 (PC) and IA64, PowerPC, SPARC and SPARC64, Alpha, ARM, and MIPS. Contents include: * Building a driver and loading modules * Complete character, block, and network drivers * Debugging a driver * Timing * Handling symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems * Memory management and DMA * Interrupts * Portability issues * Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) \#\#\# Amazon.com Review Updated to cover version 2.4.x of the Linux kernel, the second edition of *Linux Device Drivers* remains the best general-purpose, paper-bound guide for programmers wishing to make hardware devices work under the world's most popular open-source operating system. The authors take care to show how to write drivers that are portable–that is, that compile and run under all popular Linux platforms. That, along with the fact that they're careful to explain and illustrate concepts, makes this book very well suited to any programmer familiar with C but not with the hardware-software interface. It's worth noting that the emphasis in the title is on "device drivers" as much as "Linux." This book will make sense to you if you've never written a driver for any platform before. It helps if you have some Linux or Unix background, but even that is secondary as a prerequisite to C skill. For a programming text–and one concerned with low-level instructions and data structures, at that–this book is remarkably rich in prose. You'll typically want to read this book straight through, more or less skipping the code samples, before sketching out your plan for the driver you need to write. Then, go back and pay closer attention to the sections on specific details you need to implement, like custom task queues. For coding-time details about specific system calls and programming techniques, count on the index to point you to the right passages. *–David Wall* **Topics covered:** Techniques for writing hardware device drivers that run under Linux kernels 2.0.x through 2.2.x. Sections show how to manage memory, time, interrupts, ports, and other details of the hardware-software interface. \#\#\# Review 'Quite simply, It's an inspiration for anyone interested in pushing contemporary computer hardware and GNU/Linux to the limit'.

  note = {Over the last 20 years, approaches to designing speech and language processing algorithms have moved from methods based on linguistics and speech science to data-driven pattern recognition techniques. These techniques have been the focus of intense, fast-moving research and have contributed to significant advances in this field. Pattern Recognition in Speech and Language Processing offers a systematic, up-to-date presentation of these recent developments. It begins with the fundamentals and recent theoretical advances in pattern recognition, with emphasis on classifier design criteria and optimization procedures. The focus then shifts to the application of these techniques to speech processing, with chapters exploring advances in applying pattern recognition to real speech and audio processing systems. The final section of the book examines topics related to pattern recognition in language processing: topics that represent promising new trends with direct impact on information processing systems for the Web, broadcast news, and other content-rich information resources. Each self-contained chapter includes figures, tables, diagrams, and references. The collective effort of experts at the forefront of the field, Pattern Recognition in Speech and Language Processing offers in-depth, insightful discussions on new developments and contains a wealth of information integral to the further development of human-machine communications.}

  note = {Whether you're canvassing a congressional district, managing a sales region, mapping city bus schedules, or analyzing local cancer rates, thinking spatially opens up limitless possibilities for database users. PostGIS, a freely available open-source spatial database extender, can help you answer questions that you could not answer using a mere relational database. Its feature set equals or surpasses proprietary alternatives, allowing you to create location-aware queries and features with just a few lines of SQL code. *PostGIS in Action* is the first book devoted entirely to PostGIS. It will help both new and experienced users write spatial queries to solve real-world problems. For those with experience in more traditional relational databases, this book provides a background in vector-based GIS so you can quickly move to analyzing, viewing, and mapping data. Advanced users will learn how to optimize queries for maximum speed, simplify geometries for greater efficiency, and create custom functions suited specifically to their applications. It also discusses the new features available in PostgreSQL 9.0 /9.1 and PostGIS 2.0 and provides tutorials on using additional open source GIS tools in conjunction with PostGIS. \#\#\# From the Inside Flap This book isn't a substitute for the official PostGIS documentation. The official PostGIS documentation does a good job of introducing you to the myriad of functions available in PostGIS and provides examples on how to use each. It won't tell you how to combine all these functions into a recipe to solve your problems. That is the purpose of our book. Although it doesn't cover all functions available in PostGIS, this book does cover the more commonly used or interesting ones and gives you the skills you need to combine them to solve classic and more esoteric but interesting problems in spatial analysis and modeling. While you can use this book as a source of reference, we recommend that you do visit the official PostGIS site and download or peruse the documentation. This book focuses on two-dimensional non-curved Cartesian vector geometries. Although it is primarily about writing spatial queries against 2D vector geometries, we provide introductions to the following ancillary topics: * Creating 3D vector geometries * Creating curved geometries * Creating and querying the geodetic geography data type * Working with raster data using the companion raster data type (integrated in PostGIS 2.0) While the main purpose of this book is the use of PostGIS, we'd fall short of our mission if we neglected to provide some perspective on the landscape it lives in. PostGIS is not an island and rarely works alone. To complete the cycle, we also include the following: * An extensive appendix that covers PostgreSQL in great detail from setup, to backup, to security management, as well as the fundamentals of SQL and creating functions and other objects in it * Several chapters dedicated to the use of PostGIS in web mapping, viewing using desktop tools, PostgreSQL PL languages commonly used with PostGIS, and extra open source add-ons such as the TIGER geocoder, pgRouting, PL/R, and PL/ Python \#\#\# From the Back Cover **What's Inside** * An introduction to spatial databases * Geometry types, functions, and queries * Applying PostGIS to real-world problems * Extending PostGIS to web and desktop applications Familiarity with relational database concepts is helpful but not required.}

  note = {Far too many programmers and software designers consider efficient C++ to be an oxymoron. They regard C++ as inherently slow and inappropriate for performance-critical applications. Consequently, C++ has had little success penetrating domains such as networking, operating system kernels, device drivers, and others. Efficient C++ explodes that myth. Written by two authors with first-hand experience wringing the last ounce of performance from commercial C++ applications, this book demonstrates the potential of C++ to produce highly efficient programs. The book reveals practical, everyday object-oriented design principles and C++ coding techniques that can yield large performance improvements. It points out common pitfalls in both design and code that generate hidden operating costs. This book focuses on combining C++'s power and flexibility with high performance and scalability, resulting in the best of both worlds. Specific topics include temporary objects, memory management, templates, inheritance, virtual functions, inlining, reference-counting, STL, and much more. With this book, you will have a valuable compendium of the best performance techniques at your fingertips. 0201379503B04062001 \#\#\# From the Inside Flap If you conducted an informal survey of software developers on the issue of C++ performance, you would undoubtedly find that the vast majority of them view performance issues as the Achilles' heel of an otherwise fine language. We have heard it repeatedly ever since C++ burst on the corporate scene: C++ is a poor choice for implementing performance-critical applications. In the mind of developers, this particular application domain was ruled by plain C and, occasionally, even assembly language. As part of that software community we had the opportunity to watch that myth develop and gather steam. Years ago, we participated in the wave that embraced C++ with enthusiasm. All around us, many development projects plunged in headfirst. Some time later, software solutions implemented in C++ began rolling out. Their performance was typically less than optimal, to put it gently. Enthusiasm over C++ in performance-critical domains has cooled. We were in the business of supplying networking software whose execution speed was not up for negotiation–speed was top priority. Since networking software is pretty low on the software food-chain, its performance is crucial. Large numbers of applications were going to sit on top of it and depend on it. Poor performance in the low levels ripples all the way up to higher level applications. Our experience was not unique. All around, early adopters of C++ had difficulties with the resulting performance of their C++ code. Instead of attributing the difficulties to the steep learning curve of the new object-oriented software development paradigm, we blamed it on C++, the dominant language for the expression of the paradigm. Even though C++ compilers were still essentially in their infancy, the language was branded as inherently slow. This belief spread quickly and is now widely accepted as fact. Software organizations that passed on C++ frequently pointed to performance as their key concern. That concern was rooted in the perception that C++ cannot match the performance delivered by its C counterpart. Consequently, C++ has had little success penetrating software domains that view performance as top priority: operating system kernels, device drivers, networking systems (routers, gateways, protocol stacks), and more. We have spent years dissecting large systems of C and C++ code trying to squeeze every ounce of performance out of them. It is through our experience of slugging it out in the trenches that we have come to appreciate the potential of C++ to produce highly efficient programs. We've seen it done in practice. This book is our attempt to share that experience and document the many lessons we have learned in our own pursuit of C++ efficiency. Writing efficient C++ is not trivial, nor is it rocket science. It takes the understanding of some performance principles, as well as information on C++ performance traps and pitfalls. The 80-20 rule is an important principle in the world of software construction. We adopt it in the writing of this book as well: 20\% of all performance bugs will show up 80\% of the time. We therefore chose to concentrate our efforts where it counts the most. We are interested in those performance issues that arise frequently in industrial code and have significant impact. This book is not an exhaustive discussion of the set of all possible performance bugs and their solutions; hence, we will not cover what we consider esoteric and rare performance pitfalls. Our point of view is undoubtedly biased by our practical experience as programmers of server-side, performance-critical communications software. This bias impacts the book in several ways: The profile of performance issues that we encounter in practice may be slightly different in nature than those found in scientific computing, database applications, and other domains. That's not a problem. Generic performance principles transcend distinct domains, and apply equally well in domains other than networking software. At times, we invented contrived examples to drive a point home, although we tried to minimize this. We have made enough coding mistakes in the past to have a sizable collection of samples taken from real production-level code that we have worked on. Our expertise was earned the hard way–by learning from our own mistakes as well as those of our colleagues. As much as possible, we illustrated our points with real code samples. We do not delve into the asymptotic complexity of algorithms, data structures, and the latest and greatest techniques for accessing, sorting, searching, and compressing data. These are important topics, but they have been extensively covered elsewhere Knu73, BR95, KP74. Instead, we focus on simple, practical, everyday coding and design principles that yield large performance improvements. We point out common design and coding practices that lead to poor performance, whether it be through the unwitting use of language features that carry high hidden costs or through violating any number of subtle (and not so subtle) performance principles. So how do we separate myth from reality? Is C++ performance truly inferior to that of C? It is our contention that the common perception of inferior C++ performance is invalid. We concede that in general, when comparing a C program to a C++ version of what appears to be the same thing, the C program is generally faster. However, we also claim that the apparent similarity of the two programs typically is based on their data handling functionality, not their correctness, robustness, or ease of maintenance. Our contention is that when C programs are brought up to the level of C++ programs in these regards, the speed differences disappear, or the C++ versions are faster. Thus C++ is inherently neither slower nor faster. It could be either, depending on how it is used and what is required from it. It's the way it is used that matters: If used properly, C++ can yield software systems exhibiting not just acceptable performance, but yield superior software performance. We would like to thank the many people who contributed to this work. The toughest part was getting started and it was our editor, Marina Lang, who was instrumental in getting this project off the ground. Julia Sime made a significant contribution to the early draft and Yomtov Meged contributed many valuable suggestions as well. He also was the one who pointed out to us the subtle difference between our opinions and the absolute truth. Although those two notions may coincide at times, they are still distinct. Many thanks to the reviewers hired by Addison-Wesley; their feedback was extremely valuable. Thanks also to our friends and colleagues who reviewed portions of the manuscript. They are, in no particular order, Cyndy Ross, Art Francis, Scott Snyder, Tricia York, Michael Fraenkel, Carol Jones, Heather Kreger, Kathryn Britton, Ruth Willenborg, David Wisler, Bala Rajaraman, Don "Spike" Washburn, and Nils Brubaker. Last but not least, we would like to thank our wives, Cynthia Powers Bulka and Ruth Washington Mayhew. 0201379503P04062001 \#\#\# From the Back Cover Far too many programmers and software designers consider efficient C++ to be an oxymoron.

They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.}

The tools and recipes in this book will help you uncover and solve hidden (and not-so-hidden) problems with your technology, your methodology, and those difficult "people" issues on your team. Project retrospectives help teams examine what went right and what went wrong on a project. But traditionally, retrospectives (also known as "post-mortems") are only helpful at the end of the project–too late to help. You need agile retrospectives that are iterative and incremental. You need to accurately find and fix problems to help the team today. Now, Derby and Larsen show you the tools, tricks, and tips you need to fix the problems you face on a software development project on an on-going basis. You'll see how to architect retrospectives in general, how to design them specifically for your team and organization, how to run them effectively, how to make the needed changes, and how to scale these techniques up. You'll learn how to deal with problems, and implement solutions effectively throughout the project–not just at the end. With regular tune-ups, your team will hum like a precise, world-class orchestra.}

  note = {It's all in the name: *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!* is a hilarious, illustrated guide to this complex functional language. Packed with the author's original artwork, pop culture references, and most importantly, useful example code, this book teaches functional fundamentals in a way you never thought possible. You'll start with the kid stuff: basic syntax, recursion, types and type classes. Then once you've got the basics down, the real black belt master-class begins: you'll learn to use applicative functors, monads, zippers, and all the other mythical Haskell constructs you've only read about in storybooks. As you work your way through the author's imaginative (and occasionally insane) examples, you'll learn to: * Laugh in the face of side effects as you wield purely functional programming techniques * Use the magic of Haskell's "laziness" to play with infinite sets of data * Organize your programs by creating your own types, type classes, and modules * Use Haskell's elegant input/output system to share the genius of your programs with the outside world Short of eating the author's brain, you will not find a better way to learn this powerful language than reading *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!* **Excerpt from the Introduction** **Haskell is fun, and that’s what it’s all about!** This book is aimed at people who have experience programming in imperative languages—such as C++, Java, and Python—and now want to try out Haskell. But even if you don’t have any significant programming experience, I’ll bet a smart person like you will be able to follow along and learn Haskell. My first reaction to Haskell was that the language was just too weird. But after getting over that initial hurdle, it was smooth sailing. Even if Haskell seems strange to you at first, don’t give up. Learning Haskell is almost like learning to program for the first time all over again. It’s fun, and it forces you to think differently. **NOTE** *If you ever get really stuck, the IRC channel* \#haskell *on the freenode network is a great place to ask questions. The people there tend to be nice, patient, and understanding. They’re a great resource for Haskell newbies.* **So, What's Haskell?** Haskell is a *purely* functional programming language. In *imperative* programming languages, you give the computer a sequence of tasks, which it then executes. While executing them, the computer can change state. For instance, you can set the variable a to 5 and then do some stuff that might change the value of a. There are also flow-control structures for executing instructions several times, such as for and while loops. Purely functional programming is different. You don’t tell the computer what to do—you tell it what stuff is. For instance, you can tell the computer that the factorial of a number is the product of every integer from 1 to that number or that the sum of a list of numbers is the first number plus the sum of the remaining numbers. You can express both of these operations as functions. \ensuremath{>} Read the Introduction (PDF) in its entirety. \#\#\# About the Author Miran Lipovaca is a computer science student in Ljubljana, Slovenia. In addition to his passion for Haskell, he enjoys boxing, playing bass guitar, and, of course, drawing. He has a fascination with dancing skeletons and the number 71, and when he walks through automatic doors he pretends that he's actually opening them with his mind.}

  note = {\ensuremath{>} \#\#\# Joel, Apress, Blogs, and Blooks \ensuremath{>} \ensuremath{>} ...I was learning the hard way about how to be a publisher and probably spending way too much time looking at web sites and programming than I should have in response to that. Anyway, one day I came across this web site called , which was run by a guy with strong opinions and an unusual, clever writing style, along with a willingness to take on the conventional wisdom. In particular, he was writing this ongoing series about how bad most user interfaces were—mostly because programmers by and large knew, as Joel and I would say, using the same Yiddish–derived NYC vernacular that we both share, “bupkis” about what users really want. And I, like many, was hooked both by the series and the occasional random essay that Joel wrote. And then I had this epiphany: I'm a publisher, I like reading his stuff, why not turn it into a book?... \ensuremath{>} \ensuremath{>} Read the complete Foreword — Gary Cornell, Cofounder, Apress Since the release of the bestselling title *Joel on Software* in 2004, requests for a sequel have been relentless. So, we went back to the famed JoelonSoftware.com archives and pulled out a new batch of favorites, many of which have been downloaded over one million times. With Joel’s newest book, *More Joel on Software*, you’ll get an even better (not to mention updated) feast of Joel’s opinions and impressions on software development, software design, running a software business, and so much more. This is a new selection of essays from the author’s web site, http://www.joelonsoftware.com. **Joel Spolsky** started his weblog in March 2000 in order to offer his insights, based on years of experience, on how to improve the world of programming. This weblog has become infamous among the programming world, and is linked to more than 600 other web sites and translated into 30+ languages! Spolsky’s extraordinary writing skills, technical knowledge, and caustic wit have made him a programming guru. With the success of *Joel on Software*, there has been a strong demand for additional gems and advice, and this book is the answer to those requests. Containing a collection of all–new articles from the original, *More Joel on Software* has even more of an edge than the original, and the tips for running a business or managing people have far broader application than the software industry. We feel it is safe to say that this is the most useful book you will buy this year. \#\#\# What you’ll learn * The best approaches to managing and hiring extraordinary people * Advice for those interested in the software industry as a career and for managers who want to get them * Joel’s unique impressions of how to create products and design—good and bad * An “in the trenches” look at how to start and run an effective software business (or any business for that matter) * A true sense of what it takes to create a differentiated, unique, motivated organization \#\#\# Who this book is for Anyone interested in the software business will truly enjoy this book, but in particular this should be required reading for managers of technical businesses. \#\#\# Table of Contents 1.

}
  note = {System developers have used modeling languages for decades to specify, visualize, construct, and document systems. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is one of those languages. UML makes it possible for team members to collaborate by providing a common language that applies to a multitude of different systems. Essentially, it enables you to communicate solutions in a consistent, tool-supported language. Today, UML has become the standard method for modeling software systems, which means you're probably confronting this rich and expressive language more than ever before. And even though you may not write UML diagrams yourself, you'll still need to interpret diagrams written by others. *UML 2.0 in a Nutshell* from O'Reilly feels your pain. It's been crafted for professionals like you who must read, create, and understand system artifacts expressed using UML. Furthermore, it's been fully revised to cover version 2.0 of the language. This comprehensive new edition not only provides a quick-reference to all UML 2.0 diagram types, it also explains key concepts in a way that appeals to readers already familiar with UML or object-oriented programming concepts. Topics include: * The role and value of UML in projects * The object-oriented paradigm and its relation to the UML * An integrated approach to UML diagrams * Class and Object, Use Case, Sequence, Collaboration, Statechart, Activity, Component, and Deployment Diagrams * Extension Mechanisms * The Object Constraint Language (OCL) If you're new to UML, a tutorial with realistic examples has even been included to help you quickly familiarize yourself with the system. \#\#\# Review "A really good short summary of UML 2.0" - Mike James, VSJ, September 2005 "...is a very complete and precise reference to the latest UML standard. The book is a refreshingly lightweight, weighing in at just over 200 pages. That's not to say it's simply a yellow-pages style reference, because it does contain a wealth of information and explanations of everything it discusses. If you're a modeller or designer already using UML, I strongly recommend that you take a look at this book. Skimming it from cover to cover will give you a good overview of the new standard, and it will provide an invaluable desktop reference." - Mark Jones, news@UK, March 2006 \#\#\# About the Author Dan Pilone is a Software Architect with SFA, Inc., cofounder and president of Zizworks, Inc. and a terrible rock climber. He has designed and implemented systems for Hughes, ARINC, UPS, and the Naval Research Laboratory. When not writing for O'Reilly, he teaches Software Design and Software Engineering at The Catholic University in Washington DC. Originally writing in C and C++, he has moved into the blissful world of managed code with Java and C\#. He has had several articles published by Intelligent Enterprise and Java Developer's Journal on software process, consulting in the software industry, and 3D graphics in Java. Neil Pitman is Chief Technical Officer of Mahjong Mania, co-developer of LamMDA from Mindset Corporation, and formerly Vice President of Research and Development at Codagen Technologies.

  note = {"I was fortunate indeed to have worked with a fantastic team on the design and implementation of the concurrency features added to the Java platform in Java 5.0 and Java 6. Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book." –Martin Buchholz JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems "For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. Java Concurrency in Practice provides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today's–and tomorrow's–systems." –Doron Rajwan Research Scientist, Intel Corp "This is the book you need if you're writing–or designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating–multithreaded Java programs. If you've ever had to synchronize a method and you weren't sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover." –Ted Neward Author of Effective Enterprise Java "Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance." –Kirk Pepperdine CTO, JavaPerformanceTuning.com "This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it." –Dr. Cliff Click Senior Software Engineer, Azul Systems "I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers. Brian's book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach. This is a book I am recommending to all my readers of The Java Specialists' Newsletter, because it is interesting, useful, and relevant to the problems facing Java developers today." –Dr. Heinz Kabutz The Java Specialists' Newsletter "I've focused a career on simplifying simple problems, but this book ambitiously and effectively works to simplify a complex but critical subject: concurrency. Java Concurrency in Practice is revolutionary in its approach, smooth and easy in style, and timely in its delivery–it's destined to be a very important book." –Bruce Tate Author of Beyond Java "Java Concurrency in Practice is an invaluable compilation of threading know-how for Java developers. I found reading this book intellectually exciting, in part because it is an excellent introduction to Java's concurrency API, but mostly because it captures in a thorough and accessible way expert knowledge on threading not easily found elsewhere." –Bill Venners Author of Inside the Java Virtual Machine Threads are a fundamental part of the Java platform. As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In Java Concurrency in Practice, the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them. However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. Java Concurrency in Practice arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications. Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant. This book covers: *Basic concepts of concurrency and thread safety *Techniques for building and composing thread-safe classes *Using the concurrency building blocks in java.util.concurrent *Performance optimization dos and don'ts *Testing concurrent programs *Advanced topics such as atomic variables, nonblocking algorithms, and the Java Memory Model}

  note = {As the power of computing has grown over the past few decades, the field of machine learning has advanced rapidly in both theory and practice. Machine learning methods are usually based on the assumption that the data generation mechanism does not change over time. Yet real-world applications of machine learning, including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, robot control, and bioinformatics, often violate this common assumption. Dealing with non-stationarity is one of modern machine learning's greatest challenges. This book focuses on a specific non-stationary environment known as covariate shift, in which the distributions of inputs (queries) change but the conditional distribution of outputs (answers) is unchanged, and presents machine learning theory, algorithms, and applications to overcome this variety of non-stationarity. After reviewing the state-of-the-art research in the field, the authors discuss topics that include learning under covariate shift, model selection, importance estimation, and active learning. They describe such real world applications of covariate shift adaption as brain-computer interface, speaker identification, and age prediction from facial images. With this book, they aim to encourage future research in machine learning, statistics, and engineering that strives to create truly autonomous learning machines able to learn under non-stationarity. \#\#\# Review "Though important in practice and conceptually intriguing, the topic of covariate shift adaptation has only recently begun to attract significant attention in machine learning. Building on their sample reweighting methods, the authors assay a core problem of robust empirical inference. This timely book should be recommended to researchers and practitioners in a range of disciplines."**–Bernhard Schölkopf**, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems "In machine learning we often assume that the characteristics of the data used to design a system will remain the same once the system is deployed. When this assumption is violated, and it does happen often, a system's accuracy may suffer significantly. This book provides the first in-depth look at how one can prepare for and cope with a frequently occurring instance of the above problem (covariate shift) both from theoretical and practical perspectives."**–Neil Rubens**, University of Electro-Communications, Japan "Written by two active researchers in the area, this book provides a highly accessible and self-contained exposition to some of the most important and recent advancements for tackling the covariate-shift problem. Students, researchers, and practitioners in related fields will benefit greatly from its huge collection of algorithms, numerical examples, and real-life applications."**–Lihong Li**, Yahoo! Research "This book provides a clear and practical guide to the problem of learning when the training and test data are drawn from different distributions. Of particular value are the many worked examples, illustrating the operation of the described techniques on real-life problems, and demonstrating their strengths, limitations, and areas of application."**–Arthur Gretton**, Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, CSML, University College London \#\#\# About the Author Masashi Sugiyama is Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

}
  note = {This innovative book recognizes the need within the object-oriented community for a book that goes beyond the tools and techniques of the typical methodology book. In Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models, Martin Fowler focuses on the end result of object-oriented analysis and design - the models themselves. He shares with you his wealth of object modeling experience and his keen eye for identifying repeating problems and transforming them into reusable models. Analysis Patterns provides a catalogue of patterns that have emerged in a wide range of domains including trading, measurement, accounting and organizational relationships. Recognizing that conceptual patterns cannot exist in isolation, the author also presents a series of "support patterns" that discuss how to turn conceptual models into software that in turn fits into an architecture for a large information system. Included in each pattern is the reasoning behind their design, rules for when they should and should not be used, and tips for implementation. The examples presented in this book comprise a cookbook of useful models and insight into the skill of reuse that will improve analysis, modeling and implementation.0201895420B07092001 \#\#\# Amazon.com Review Patterns are higher-order designs that can be reused across projects and types of computer systems. *Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models* defines over 70 patterns, beginning with some from the business world, such as the Party and Accountability patterns, which define the players in organizations and whom they report to. Many of the other patterns are drawn from the health care industry and mainly show patterns of doctor-patient interactions. The patterns for financial markets will probably be accessible for the majority of readers. Author Martin Fowler defines a Transaction pattern (and related patterns) as well as several patterns for the Accounting of Objects. He moves on to modeling stock markets with Portfolio, Quote, and Scenario patterns, which define how a price for a stock is determined for a given moment. Interestingly, he establishes patterns for Forward Contracts (for derivatives) as well as Options, and so takes on a complicated area in today's financial markets. Fowler's considerable design experience in these fields is beneficial, as he is able to define each pattern in both text and software engineering diagrams. Only rarely does the author provide implementations of these designs and those that are furnished are done in Smalltalk, which makes this book more suitable for those who have experience in object design. \#\#\# From the Inside Flap Not long ago, no books were available on object-oriented analysis and design. Now there are so many that it is impossible for any practitioner to keep up with them all. Most of these books concentrate on teaching a notation, suggesting a simple process for modeling, and illustrating it with a few simple examples. Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models is a different kind of book. Instead of focusing on the process - how to do modeling - it concentrates on the result of the process - the models themselves. I am a consultant in object modeling for information systems. Clients ask me to train staff on modeling and to provide mentoring on projects. Much of my skill comes from a knowledge of modeling techniques and how to use them. More important, however, is my experience in actually creating many models and regularly seeing problems repeat themselves. Frequently I find that many aspects of a project revisit problems I have faced before. That experience allows me to reuse models I have built before, improve them, and adapt them to new demands. Over the last few years, more and more people have also become aware of this phenomenon. We have realized that the typical methodology books, though valuable, only present the first step in a learning process that must also capture the actual things that are built. This realization has flowered into the patterns movement. This is a varied group of people, representing many different interests and opinions yet sharing the goal of propagating useful patterns of software systems. As a result of the diversity of this patterns community, we have had difficulty in defining the term pattern. We all think we can recognize a pattern when we see it, we think most of us would agree in most cases, but we cannot come up with a single definition. Here is my definition: A pattern is an idea that has been useful in one practical context and will probably be useful in others. I like to leave the definition quite loose because I wish to stay as close to the underlying motivation of patterns, without adding too many restrictive amendments. A pattern can have many forms, and each form adds specializations that are useful for that kind of pattern. (Section 1.2 discusses the current state of the patterns world and where this book fits in.)This book is about patterns in analysis, patterns that reflect conceptual structures of business processes rather than actual software implementations. Most of the chapters discuss patterns for various business domains. Such patterns are hard to classify into traditional vertical areas (manufacturing, finance, health care, and so on) because they are often useful in several areas. These patterns are important because they help us to understand how people perceive the world. It is valuable to base a computer system's design on this perception and, indeed, to change that perception - which is where business process reengineering (BPR) comes in. Conceptual patterns cannot exist in isolation, however. Conceptual models are only useful to software engineers if they can see how to implement them. In this book I present patterns that can be used to turn conceptual models into software, and I discuss how that software fits into an architecture for a large information system. I also discuss specific implementation tips with the patterns. I wrote this book because this was the book that I wanted to read when I started out. Modelers will find ideas in this book to help them begin working in a new domain. The patterns contain useful models, the reasoning behind their designs, and when they should and should not be applied. With this information a modeler can adapt the models to fit a specific problem. The patterns in this book can also be used in reviewing models - to see what might have been left out and to suggest some alternatives that may lead to improvement. When I review a project, I usually compare what I see with the patterns I have learned from previous work. I have found that being aware of patterns in my work helps me to apply my past experiences more easily. Patterns like this also uncover modeling issues that go beyond what can be covered in a simple text book. By discussing why we model things the way we do, we gain a greater understanding of how to improve our modeling, even if we don't use the patterns directly. Structure of this Book This book is divided into two sections. The first section covers analysis patterns, which are patterns from conceptual business models. They provide key abstractions from domains such as trading, measurement, accounting, and organizational relationships. The patterns are conceptual because they represent the way people think about the business, rather than the way a computer system is designed. The chapters in this section stress alternative patterns that can be used, and the strengths and weaknesses of those alternatives. Although each pattern will clearly be useful to those working in the same domain, the basic pattern is often useful in other domains. The second section focuses on support patterns, which help you use analysis patterns. Support patterns show how analysis patterns fit into an information systems architecture, how the constructs of conceptual models turn into software interfaces and implementations, and how certain advanced modeling constructs relate to simpler structures.To describe these patterns, I need a notation. The appendix provides a brief discussion of the notation I use and what the symbols mean. I do not use a single method but prefer to mix techniques from different methods. The appendix is not designed to be a tutorial on techniques, but it should provide an outline and refresh your memory. It also tells you where to find a tutorial on the techniques I use. Each section is divided into chapters. Each chapter on analysis patterns contains patterns that are related by a loose notion of subject area, influenced by the projects that spawned them. This organization reflects the fact that any pattern must come from a practical context. Each pattern appears in its own subsection within a chapter. I do not use any of the formal headings for patterns that are used by some patterns authors (see Section 1.2.2). I describe each pattern in a form that is as close to the original project form as is reasonable, with a minimum of abstraction. I add examples to show the use of the pattern within its original domain and also to suggest how the pattern might be used in other domains. One of the greatest difficulties of patterns is abstracting them into other domains; I follow the principle that this should be left to the reader (see Section 1.2.3). This book is thus a catalog, rather than a book to be read from cover to cover. I have tried to write each chapter in such a way that it can be read independently from the other chapters. (This is not always possible, however. Whenever a chapter requires that another chapter be read first, I say so in the chapter introduction.) Each chapter has an introduction that explains the general subject area of the chapter, summarizes the patterns in the chapter, and says what projects the patterns originated from. How to Read this BookI suggest reading all of Chapter 1 first and then reading each chapter introduction. Then feel free to delve into the chapters in any order you like. If you are not familiar with the approach I take to modeling, or the notation and concepts I use, read the appendix. The Table of Patterns gives a brief summary of what each pattern is about, so you can use that to help you explore or to find a pattern when you come back to the book at a later time. It is important to stress that each pattern in this book is useful outside the domain that gave it birth. Thus I encourage you to look into chapters that you might think are outside your field of interest. For example, I found that models of observation and measurement designed for health care proved to be very useful for corporate financial analysis. Who Should Read this BookThis book can be useful to a range of readers, although different readers will learn different things from it and may need some different preparations.I expect my biggest audience to be analysts and designers of object-oriented (OO) computer systems, particularly those working at the analysis end. Such readers should have made at least some use of an OO analysis and design method. This book does not provide any introduction to this subject, so I would suggest first reading a book on OO analysis and design if you are new to this field. I must stress that the patterns in this book are conceptual in nature, and I use a very conceptual approach to modeling. This leads to some stylistic differences from those texts that use a more implementation-based approach to modeling. A small, but very important, audience consists of those people who act as domain experts for a modeling project. Such readers do not require a knowledge of computers but do need to know about conceptual modeling. One of the main reasons I use conceptual models in this book is to make things easier for this group of readers. The modeling project here may be analysis for computer system development or BPR. I have taught many professionals (including doctors, financial traders, accountants, nurses, and payroll supervisors) this kind of modeling and have found that a software background is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage to conceptual modeling. The business model patterns are as much about business modeling as they are about computer systems analysis (see Section 1.4). Any such reader should take a course on OO analysis that stresses the conceptual aspect. (Odell's book Martin, J., and J. Odell, Object-Oriented Methods: A Foundation, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1995 is particularly valuable in this respect.) I hope many programmers will delve between these covers, although some programmers may take exception to the lack of code and the conceptual slant. For these readers I suggest you take particular note of Chapter 14, which should help to explain the relationship between the conceptual models and the resulting software. This is an object-oriented book, and I do not hesitate in proclaiming my belief that the object-oriented approach is the superior way to develop software. These models, however, are primarily conceptual models, and many data modelers have had a long tradition of using conceptual (or logical) models. Data modelers should find many of the patterns useful, particularly if they use more advanced semantic techniques. The object-oriented features of the models will reveal many of the differences between object-oriented and traditional approaches. I would encourage such readers to use this book in conjunction with an OO analysis book that stresses the conceptual side of modeling and the links between OO and semantic data modeling. Managers will find the book useful as a starting point for development activity. Starting from a pattern can help to clarify goals, and project planning can take advantage of the broad ground that patterns map out. I have not aimed this book at students. I've written it more for the professional software engineer. I hope, however, that some students will take a look. When I was learning analysis and design, I found it difficult because there were few good examples I could learn from, examples that came out of the world outside the university. Just as looking at good code can teach you a lot about programming, looking at good models can teach you a lot about analysis and design. A Living BookEvery author I know shares a frustration: Once a book is published it is fixed. The book spreads its advice around the community, yet the author has little way of expressing changes. I know how much I keep learning, and I am sure this learning will modify my ideas. I want these changes to be passed on to my readers. With this book, Addison-Wesley will provide a web site which will be used to pass on further materials to keep this book alive. At this stage I am not sure exactly what it will contain, but I expect the following: any new things I learn about the patterns in the book answers to questions about the book useful commentary from others about the patterns new analysis patterns by myself, and by others When the Unified Modeling Notation appears (or whatever it is called by then) I will redraw all the diagrams in the book in the new notation and put them on the site. This site will be a complement to the book, so keep an eye on it and use it to let me know how to improve and develop the ideas between these pages. AcknowledgmentsAny author is indebted to many others who help. For this book this is particularly true since so many of the patterns were built with the help of my clients, colleagues, and friends. I would like to give my sincere thanks to the following, both named and implied.First and foremost, Jim Odell has been an essential part of my career. He has taught me much about developing information systems and has been a constant source of inspiration, helpful advice, and strange humor. I can safely say that without his support this book would not have happened. The team at Coopers \& Lybrand in London helped with much of the early work and helped pass many evenings at Smithfield's. John Edwards formed many of my early ideas about conceptual modeling and its role in software development, as well as introducing me to many interesting ideas, including those of Christopher Alexander. John Hope urged me to think of the domain first and technology second, as well as casting a helpful spell at several key points in my career. Tom Cairns and Mark Thursz, doctors at St. Mary's Hospital in London, worked with me in developing the health care models that form the basis of Chapters 2, 3, and 8. They are proof that a computer background is not necessary to be a top-class conceptual modeler. Mark also was a willing source for health care examples with impressive-sounding medical terminology.The health care projects also involved many software and health care professionals from St. Mary's, the Hospital for Sick Children (HSC), St. Thomas's Hospital, and the University of Wales. Anne Casey, a nurse at HSC, and Hazim Timimi, an analyst, helped put together the final Cosmos model. Gerry Gold set up this work and made sure it kept going. Brad Kain has had a great impact on my thinking on reuse and components, as well as undertaking the important task of showing me the nightlife of Boston. Applying the health care models to corporate finance in Chapter 4 was the experience that, for me, proved the usefulness of analysis patterns across different domains. Lynne Halpin and Craig Lockwood led the MBFW team at Xerox, and Vivek Salgar got our conceptual ideas into the brutal reality of C++. David Creager, Steve Shepherd, and their team at Citibank worked with me in developing the models from which I drew the financial patterns in Chapters 9-11. They also further developed many of the architectural ideas of Chapter 12 from their health care origins, and taught me much about the frenetic life in The City. Fred Peel set up and maintained my work at Citibank, when not scaring me with his driving. Daniel Poon and Hazim Timimi from Valbecc got many of my fuzzy ideas into detailed specifications. The accounting patterns in Chapter 6 have had a long gestation. Tom Daly, Peter Swettenham, Tom Hadfield, and their respective teams developed models that gave birth to the patterns in this book. Rich Garzaniti got my accounting terminology sorted out. Kent Beck did much to improve my Smalltalk. Chapter 14 was written with the help of James Odell. I have been very much a latecomer to the patterns community, getting to know it well only after most of this book was written. It is a very open and friendly group that has done much to encourage my work. Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, and Jim Coplein encouraged me to get involved with the community and to develop my ideas as patterns. Ralph Johnson provided particularly helpful comments on the first draft of this book. I have had first-class comments from my many reviewers whom I would like to name: Dave Collins, Ward Cunningham (Cunningham \& Cunningham, Inc.), Henry A. Etlinger (Department of Computer Science, RIT), Donald G. Firesmith (Knowledge Systems Corporation), Erich Gamma, Adele Goldberg, Tom Hadfield (TesserAct Technology), Lynne Halpin (Netscape Communications), Brian Henderson-Sellers, Neil Hunt (Pure Software), Ralph E. Johnson (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Jean-Pierre Kuilboer (University of Massachusetts, Boston), Patrick D. Logan (Intel Corporation), James Odell, Charles Richter (Objective Engineering, Inc.), Douglas C. Schmidt (Washington University), and Dan Tasker. I will mention that Don Firesmith went above the call of duty in tracking down problems that needed to be fixed. As this is my first book, I'm particularly grateful to those at Addison-Wesley who helped me through the process. Carter Shanklin directed affairs and assembled a formidable panel of reviewers with much assistance from Angela Buenning. Teri Hyde coordinated the book production on a painfully tight schedule and Barbara Conway rescued my prose from its usual erratic state, and ruthlessly eliminated my native accent. 0201895420P04062001}

How can today's computers perform such a bewildering variety of tasks if computing is just glorified arithmetic? The answer, as Martin Davis lucidly illustrates, lies in the fact that computers are engines of logic. Their hardware and software embody concepts developed over centuries by logicians such as Leibniz, Boole, and Godel, culminating in the amazing insights of Alan Turing. Readers will come away from this book with a revelatory understanding of how and why computers work.}

  note = {"...not only the best book on Qt I have ever seen, but also the best book presenting any programming framework. Every sentence appears to be carefully worded, and every chapter has a sound concept, and so does the work as a whole." –Matthias Ettrich, Trolltech's lead developer, founder of the KDE project "The 'Tao of Qt'.... The Qt system is a beautiful example of object oriented design, and the authors take advantage of this.... The authors have done an excellent job of presenting the subject in an interesting and engaging way...." –Ron McCarty, Instructor and Chair of the Department of Computer Science, Penn State Erie, The Behrend College The first official Trolltech guide to Qt 3.2 programming! Straight from Trolltech, this book covers all you need to build industrial-strength applications with Qt 3.2.x and C++–applications that run natively on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and embedded Linux with no source code changes! The book teaches solid Qt programming practices; it is not a rehash of the documentation. You'll find start-to-finish coverage packed with examples, plus a CD with the Qt 3.2 toolset and Borland C++ compilers–including a non-commercial Qt 3.2 for Windows available nowhere else! Build powerful C++ GUI applications quickly and easily Design dialogs and main windows visually and in code Learn Qt's innovative typesafe signals and slots mechanism Use layouts to create forms that automatically size and scale Create custom signals, slots, events, and controls Program the "Qt way" with techniques for Qt 3.2 that'll work with Qt 4 Code applicationswith menus, toolbars, dialogs, and drag and drop Utilize 2D and 3D graphics, multithreading, and networking Write database and XML applications Internationalize to reach foreign markets Exploit platform-specific-features like ActiveX Already using Qt or just starting out?

  date = {2003-01},
}
  note = {The Fifteenth Edition is available in book form and as a subscription Web site. The same content from The Chicago Manual of Style is in both versions.In the 1890s, a proofreader at the University of Chicago Press prepared a single sheet of typographic fundamentals intended as a guide for the University community. That sheet grew into a pamphlet, and the pamphlet grew into a book—the first edition of the Manual of Style, published in 1906. Now in its fifteenth edition, The Chicago Manual of Style—the essential reference for authors, editors, proofreaders, indexers, copywriters, designers, and publishers in any field—is more comprehensive and easier to use than ever before.Those who work with words know how dramatically publishing has changed in the past decade, with technology now informing and influencing every stage of the writing and publishing process. In creating the fifteenth edition of the Manual, Chicago's renowned editorial staff drew on direct experience of these changes, as well as on the recommendations of the Manual's first advisory board, composed of a distinguished group of scholars, authors, and professionals from a wide range of publishing and business environments.Every aspect of coverage has been examined and brought up to date—from publishing formats to editorial style and method, from documentation of electronic sources to book design and production, and everything in between. In addition to books, the Manual now also treats journals and electronic publications. All chapters are written for the electronic age, with advice on how to prepare and edit manuscripts online, handle copyright and permissions issues raised by technology, use new methods of preparing mathematical copy, and cite electronic and online sources.A new chapter covers American English grammar and usage, outlining the grammatical structure of English, showing how to put words and phrases together to achieve clarity, and identifying common errors. The two chapters on documentation have been reorganized and updated: the first now describes the two main systems preferred by Chicago, and the second discusses specific elements and subject matter, with examples of both systems. Coverage of design and manufacturing has been streamlined to reflect what writers and editors need to know about current procedures. And, to make it easier to search for information, each numbered paragraph throughout the Manual is now introduced by a descriptive heading.Clear, concise, and replete with commonsense advice, The Chicago Manual of Style, fifteenth edition, offers the wisdom of a hundred years of editorial practice while including a wealth of new topics and updated perspectives. For anyone who works with words, whether on a page or computer screen, this continues to be the one reference book you simply must have.What's new in the Fifteenth Edition:* Updated material throughout to reflect current style, technology, and professional practice* Scope expanded to include journals and electronic publications* Comprehensive new chapter on American English grammar and usage by Bryan A. Garner (author of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage)* Updated and rewritten chapter on preparing mathematical copy* Reorganized and updated chapters on documentation, including guidance on citing electronic sources* Streamlined coverage of current design and production processes, with a glossary of key terms* Descriptive headings on all numbered paragraphs for ease of reference* New diagrams of the editing and production processes for both books and journals, keyed to chapter discussions* New, expanded Web site with special tools and features for Manual users at www.chicagomanualofstyle.org.}

  note = {*Java and SOAP* provides Java developers with an in-depth look at SOAP (the Simple Object Access Protocol). Of course, it covers the basics: what SOAP is, why it's soared to a spot on the Buzzwords' Top Ten list, and what its features and capabilities are. And it shows you how to work with some of the more common Java APIs in the SOAP world: Apache SOAP and GLUE. In addition to covering the basics such as the structure of a SOAP message, SOAP encoding, and building simple services using RPC and messaging, Java and SOAP covers many topics that are essential to real-world development. Although SOAP has native support for an impressive number of object types, the nature of modern programming means that whatever SOAP gives you is not enough. When do you need to add support for your own object types, and how do you do it? How do you handle errors, and how do you add your own information to Fault messages? How do you handle attachments? In an ideal world, you could live entirely within Java, and ignore the SOAP messages being send back and forth: you'd be able to write Java code and let the SOAP APIs work behind the scenes. However, we're not yet in that ideal world, and won't be for some time. Therefore, Java and SOAP pays particular attention to how SOAP messages are encoded. It doesn't just explain the document types, but shows how the documents are used in practice as they are generated by the different APIs. If you ever have to debug interoperability problems, you'll find that this information is indispensable. We've always found that the best software is written by people who understand what's happening under the hood. SOAP is no different. Let's say you need to write a custom serializer to create a SOAP representation of a structure. How do you know that your encoding is efficient? There's one definitive answer: look at the SOAP documents it produces! *Java and SOAP* also discusses interoperability between the major SOAP platforms, including Microsoft's .NET, SOAP messaging, SOAP attachments, message routing, and a preview of the forthcoming AXIS APIs and server. If you're a Java developer who would like to start working with SOAP, this is the book you need to get going. \#\#\# About the Author Robert Englander is Principal Engineer and President of MindStream Software, Inc.

  note = {Although MySQL's source code is open in the sense of being publicly available, it's essentially closed to you if you don't understand it. In this book, Sasha Pachev – a former member of the MySQL Development Team – provides a comprehensive tour of MySQL 5 that shows you how to figure out the inner workings of this powerful database. You'll go right to heart of the database to learn how data structures and convenience functions operate, how to add new storage engines and configuration options, and much more. The core of *Understanding MySQL Internals* begins with an Architecture Overview that provides a brief introduction of how the different components of MySQL work together. You then learn the steps for setting up a working compilable copy of the code that you can change and test at your pleasure. Other sections of the book cover: * Core server classes, structures, and API * The communication protocol between the client and the server * Configuration variables, the controls of the server; includes a tutorial on how to add your own * Thread-based request handling – understanding threads and how they are used in MySQL * An overview of MySQL storage engines * The storage engine interface for integrating third-party storage engines * The table lock manager * The parser and optimizer for improving MySQL's performance * Integrating a transactional storage engine into MySQL * The internals of replication *Understanding MySQL Internals* provides unprecedented opportunities for developers, DBAs, database application programmers, IT departments, software vendors, and computer science students to learn about the inner workings of this enterprise-proven database. With this book, you will soon reach a new level of comprehension regarding database development that will enable you to accomplish your goals. It's your guide to discovering and improving a great database. \#\#\# About the Author Sasha Pachev graduated from the Brigham Young University in 1998 with a degree in Computer Science, worked on the MySQL development team in 2000-2002, and was the original developer of replication in MySQL. In 2003 he wrote his first book *MySQL Enterprise Solutions*. He currently lives in Provo, Utah with his wife Sarah and his five children working as an independent consultant with the emphasis on MySQL. In spite of his great interest in computers, Sasha is equally passionate about distance running. He has won a number of marathons, has a personal best of 2:24:47, and is attempting to qualify for the US Olympic Trials. He feels it is important to help other runners reach their potential, and operates a web site *http://FastRunningBlog.Com* dedicated to that purpose.}

  note = {Information theory and inference, often taught separately, are here united in one entertaining textbook. These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes – the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.}

I didn't like the way the bootscripts were arranged, or I didn't like the way certain programs were configured by default and more of those things. I came to realize that when I want to be totally satisfied with a Linux system, I have to build my own Linux system from scratch. Ideally only using the source code. No pre-compiled packages of any kind. No help from some sort of cdrom or bootdisk that would install some basic utilities. You would use your current Linux system and use that one to build your own. This, at one time, wild idea seemed very difficult and at times almost impossible. The reason for most problems were due to my lack of knowledge about certain programs and procedures. After I sorted out all kinds of dependency problems, compilation problems, etcetera, a manually Linux system was created and fully operational. I called this system and LFS system which stands for Linux From Scratch."}

Based on notes that have been class-tested for more than a decade, it isaimed at cognitive science and neuroscience students who need to understand brainfunction in terms of computational modeling, and at engineers who want to go beyondformal algorithms to applications and computing strategies. It is the only currenttext to approach networks from a broad neuroscience and cognitive scienceperspective, with an emphasis on the biology and psychology behind the assumptionsof the models, as well as on what the models might be used for. It describes themathematical and computational tools needed and provides an account of the author'sown ideas.Students learn how to teach arithmetic to a neural network and get a shortcourse on linear associative memory and adaptive maps. They are introduced to theauthor's brain-state-in-a-box (BSB) model and are provided with some of theneurobiological background necessary for a firm grasp of the general subject.Thefield now known as neural networks has split in recent years into two major groups, mirrored in the texts that are currently available: the engineers who are primarilyinterested in practical applications of the new adaptive, parallel computingtechnology, and the cognitive scientists and neuroscientists who are interested inscientific applications. As the gap between these two groups widens, Anderson notesthat the academics have tended to drift off into irrelevant, often excessivelyabstract research while the engineers have lost contact with the source of ideas inthe field. Neuroscience, he points out, provides a rich and valuable source of ideasabout data representation and setting up the data representation is the major partof neural network programming. Both cognitive science and neuroscience give insightsinto how this can be done effectively: cognitive science suggests what to computeand neuroscience suggests how to compute it.}

  date = {2000-01},
  note = {XML is a text-based markup language that has taken the programming world by storm. More powerful than HTML yet less demanding than SGML, XML has proven itself to be flexible and resilient. XML is the perfect tool for formatting documents with even the smallest bit of complexity, from Web pages to legal contracts to books. However, XML has also proven itself to be indispensable for organizing and conveying other sorts of data as well, thus its central role in web services like SOAP and XML-RPC. As the Perl programming language was tailor-made for manipulating text, few people have disputed the fact that Perl and XML are perfectly suited for one another. The only question has been what's the best way to do it. That's where this book comes in. *Perl \& XML* is aimed at Perl programmers who need to work with XML documents and data. The book covers all the major modules for XML processing in Perl, including XML::Simple, XML::Parser, XML::LibXML, XML::XPath, XML::Writer, XML::Pyx, XML::Parser::PerlSAX, XML::SAX, XML::SimpleObject, XML::TreeBuilder, XML::Grove, XML::DOM, XML::RSS, XML::Generator::DBI, and SOAP::Lite. But this book is more than just a listing of modules; it gives a complete, comprehensive tour of the landscape of Perl and XML, making sense of the myriad of modules, terminology, and techniques. This book covers: * parsing XML documents and writing them out again * working with event streams and SAX * tree processing and the Document Object Model * advanced tree processing with XPath and XSLT Most valuably, the last two chapters of Perl \& XML give complete examples of XML applications, pulling together all the tools at your disposal. All together, *Perl \& XML* is the single book that gives you a solid grounding in XML processing with Perl. \#\#\# About the Author Jason McIntosh lives and works in and around Boston. He has co-authored two O'Reilly books, Mac OS X in a Nutshell and Perl \& XML, and writes occasional columns and weblog entries for the O'Reilly Network. His homepage is at http://www.jmac.org.}

These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper "No Silver Bullet"; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, "There will be no silver bullet within ten years."}

Readers learn about the state of the Linux gaming world, and how to write and distribute Linux games to the Linux gaming community. \#\#\# From the Publisher A great operating system for programmers and system administrators, Linux is also a great gaming platform, and the market is exploding. Linux users want to do everything under Linux—including playing computer games. And the Linux operating system is fast even without a fast processor, which means that even an older machine can be a great Linux gaming machine. Gaming will continue to drive the adoption of Linux as an operating system. In fact, one game, Quake, has already indirectly contributed to the growth of Linux. Estimates are that over 60 percent of all dedicated Quake servers (for all versions on the Internet) are Linux machines. \#\#\# From the Author I wrote Programming Linux Games for the casual Linux hobbyist who wants to learn about game programming, as well as the professional game programmer or multimedia engineer who would like to gain a familiarity with the Linux platform. I start with a birds-eye view of the game industry, and explore the elements that make up various types of games. After a quick review of Linux development tools and multimedia programming toolkits, I launch into the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), several audio playback APIs (OSS, ALSA, and ESD), the OpenAL environmental audio system, the Tcl scripting library, Linux's new framebuffer device API (fbdev). I also explain how to access the keyboard and mouse under Linux. These tools provide everything you need to create games and other multimedia applications for Linux, as well as port games from other platforms. Programming Linux Games does not cover 3D graphics programming techniques, as OpenGL programming is more or less the same under any platform. However, there is a brief explanation of how to use SDL as an improved replacement for the popular GLUT toolkit. ∼John R. Hall August 22, 2001}

From the Preface: We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form. As we said in the first preface to the first edition, C "wears well as one's experience with it grows." With a decade more experience, we still feel that way. We hope that this book will help you to learn C and use it well.}

Comparisons are presented of different algorithms that may be used for similar purposes, including a selection of representative pictures from light and electron microscopes as well as macroscopic, satellite, and astronomical images. Developments in graphic information, covering the array of concepts and techniques in high-end imaging software, are detailed. With balanced, complete descriptions, the text outlines frequency space methods with extensive mathematical presentation and spatial domain processing - requiring only a modest technical background in mathematics or computers. This handbook teaches by example: By seeing what various operations do to representative images, the reader will discover how and why to use them. Image Processing Handbook encourages the reader to use its information with a real source of images and a computer-based system as well as to freely experiment with different methods to determine the most appropriate for his or her particular needs. To facilitate the learning process, Reindeer Games in Charlotte, NC offers The Image Processing Tool Kit - a CD-ROM containing more than 150 images and more than 150 Photoshop®-compatible plug-ins that implement the algorithms discussed.

Including and updating the full mathematical and explanatory contents of Numerical Recipes in C, this new version incorporates completely new C++ versions of the more than 300 Numerical Recipes routines that are widely recognized as the most accessible and practical basis for scientific computing. The product of a unique collaboration among four leading scientists in academic research and industry, Numerical Recipes is a complete text and reference book on scientific computing. In a self-contained manner it proceeds from mathematical and theoretical considerations to actual practical computer routines. Highlights include linear algebra, interpolation, special functions, random numbers, nonlinear sets of equations, optimization, eigensystems, Fourier methods and wavelets, statistical tests, ODEs and PDEs, integral equations and inverse theory. The authors approach to C++ preserves the efficient execution that C users expect, while simultaneously employing a clear, object-oriented interface to the routines. Tricks and tips for scientific computing in C++ are liberally included. The routines, in ANSI/ISO C++ source code, can thus be used with almost any existing C++ vector/matrix class library, according to user preference. A simple class library for stand-alone use is also included in the book. Both scientific programmers new to C++, and experienced C++ programmers who need access to the Numerical Recipes routines, can benefit from this important new version of an invaluable, classic text.}

  note = {Discrete optimization problems are everywhere, from traditional operations research planning problems, such as scheduling, facility location, and network design; to computer science problems in databases; to advertising issues in viral marketing. Yet most such problems are NP-hard. Thus unless P = NP, there are no efficient algorithms to find optimal solutions to such problems. This book shows how to design approximation algorithms: efficient algorithms that find provably near-optimal solutions. The book is organized around central algorithmic techniques for designing approximation algorithms, including greedy and local search algorithms, dynamic programming, linear and semidefinite programming, and randomization. Each chapter in the first part of the book is devoted to a single algorithmic technique, which is then applied to several different problems. The second part revisits the techniques but offers more sophisticated treatments of them. The book also covers methods for proving that optimization problems are hard to approximate. Designed as a textbook for graduate-level algorithms courses, the book will also serve as a reference for researchers interested in the heuristic solution of discrete optimization problems.}

  note = {Core CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is the definitive guide to style sheets, which provide a new level of flexibility for Web developers. Cascading Styles Sheets provide both casual Web authors and professional Web developers with the tools necessary to precisely control such things as the size and appearance of fonts, positioning elements at exact locations on a page-even how a page should be printed or "sound" when played through a compatible browser. This new edition of the book incorporates the latest browser-specific extensions to CSS, as well as the CSS3 specification, providing the most up-to-date information on CSS currently available. Core CSS delivers practical techniques for integrating CSS into Web site development and expert insight into choosing the best style sheet code. Like all Core series books it features hundreds of professional-level code examples. \#\#\# Amazon.com Review Useful for both Web designers and developers, *Core CSS: Cascading Style Sheets* provides a definitive guide to style sheets, which provide a new level of flexibility for browser-based content. With a comprehensive reference to all CSS1 and CSS2 features and an excellent survey of which features work in eight of today's browsers, this book shows off the strengths of style sheets for the next generation of Web content. Particularly for developers, CSS allows more precise control of elements inside browsers, making it a lot easier to create Web clients that compete with traditional stand-alone applications. But support for CSS in today's browsers is spotty. The strength of this book is that it explains both the CSS1 and CSS2 standards, even though they are still under development. This text shows off what each property is *supposed* to accomplish with sample HTML and screenshots. The author is careful to note problems with CSS properties in today's browsers. For the CSS1 standard, every property is marked as being unsafe, safe, or partially implemented on no less than eight browsers (including Netscape 3 and 4.x, Internet Explorer 3 through 5, and Opera for Windows, UNIX, and Mac platforms). The second part of the book is devoted to the CSS2 standard with a description of proposed support for Unicode, for formatting Web pages (with paged media properties), and for tagging content so that it can be read out loud by computer-generated voices. Although still under construction, the CSS1 and CSS2 standards will certainly offer a better Internet for us all. In the meantime, *Core CSS: Cascading Style Sheets* describes what's available in today's browsers. It's a solid reference that will make CSS understandable to anyone, regardless of their level of Web expertise. *–Richard Dragan* **Topics covered**: Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), the CSS1 and CSS2 standards, the browser wars, CSS support on the Netscape, Internet Explorer, Opera and Mozilla browsers; basic CSS (grouping, inheritance, and contextual selectors), cascading order, CSS units, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, font properties, color and background properties, text and box properties, classification properties, new CSS2 features, Unicode support, generated content and automatic numbering for lists, properties for printing Web pages, new table properties, aural style sheets for speech-enabled browsers, CSS1 and CSS2 reference and cross-browser comparison of supported properties. \#\#\# From the Back Cover The Complete and Comprehensive Web Developer's Guide to Style Sheets Core CSS, 2nd Edition is a comprehensive guide that shows both beginning and expert Web developers all they need to know to achieve great results with the latest style sheet properties. In this example-rich book, Schengili-Roberts provides in-depth coverage of the CSS1 and CSS2 standards, provides a "head's up" look at what to expect in the forthcoming CSS3 specification, and covers those CSS properties specific to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. It is the most complete and up-to-date CSS reference available. CSS is fundamental to current Web design, allowing you to separate content from formatting, and to do Web page layout in ways simply not possible using regular HTML. Most books on CSS simply look at how you can accomplish certain formatting tricks, but this book delves deeper, looking at how each CSS property works, what CSS is capable of, and what to expect in the near future. This book provides the most accessible and up-to-date listing available on CSS compatibility across browsers and operating systems so Webmasters can finally know which CSS properties are "safe" to use. Detailed appendices provide full CSS property listings, compatibility charts, and more. Core CSS, 2nd Edition delivers: * Practical techniques for integrating CSS into your Web site development * Expert insight into choosing the best style sheet code * Hundreds of professional-quality code examples * An overview of new CSS3 properties}

Clojure's clean, careful design lets you write programs that get right to the essence of a problem, without a lot of clutter and ceremony. Clojure is Lisp reloaded. Clojure has the power inherent in Lisp, but is not constrained by the history of Lisp. Clojure is a functional language. Data structures are immutable, and functions tend to be side-effect free. This makes it easier to write correct programs, and to compose large programs from smaller ones. Clojure is concurrent. Rather than error-prone locking, Clojure provides software transactional memory. Clojure embraces Java. Calling from Clojure to Java is direct, and goes through no translation layer. Clojure is fast. Wherever you need it, you can get the exact same performance that you could get from hand-written Java code. Many other languages offer some of these features, but the combination of them all makes Clojure sparkle. Programming Clojure shows you why these features are so important, and how you can use Clojure to build powerful programs quickly.}

Architecture of a Database System presents an architectural discussion of DBMS design principles, including process models, parallel architecture, storage system design, transaction system implementation, query processor and optimizer architectures, and typical shared components and utilities. Successful commercial and open-source systems are used as points of reference, particularly when multiple alternative designs have been adopted by different groups. Historically, DBMSs were among the earliest multi-user server systems to be developed, and thus pioneered many systems design techniques for scalability and reliability now in use in many other contexts. While many of the algorithms and abstractions used by a DBMS are textbook material, Architecture of a Database System addresses the systems design issues that make a DBMS work. Architecture of a Database System is an invaluable reference for database researchers and practitioners and for those in other areas of computing interested in the systems design techniques for scalability and reliability that originated in DBMS research and development.}

  note = {This introductory book emphasizes algorithms and applications, such as cryptography and error correcting codes, and is accessible to a broad audience. The presentation alternates between theory and applications in order to motivate and illustrate the mathematics. The mathematical coverage includes the basics of number theory, abstract algebra and discrete probability theory. This edition now includes over 150 new exercises, ranging from the routine to the challenging, that flesh out the material presented in the body of the text, and which further develop the theory and present new applications. The material has also been reorganized to improve clarity of exposition and presentation. Ideal as a textbook for introductory courses in number theory and algebra, especially those geared towards computer science students. \#\#\# Review "The subject matter is presented in a very thorough way. Detailed and clear proofs are given for (almost) all results. The material is very well organized: definitions, results, and their interrelations fit together perfectly. The book is especially attractive to students with a background or interest in computer science. On the other hand, students who already have a background in abstract algebra can benefit greatly from this book by skipping some parts where algebraic theory is introduced. The suitability of the book for self-study is greatly enhanced by a wealth of exercises and examples that are provided. Last but not least, the book is very well-written, and it is a pleasure to read. Gregor Kemper, Mathematics of Computation "It's a pleasure to find a book that is so masterful and so well written that it has all the hallmarks of a classic. This is such a book.This is a truly magnificent text, deserving of a place on the shelves of any mathematician or computer scientist working in these areas." Alasdair McAndrew, Computing Reviews \#\#\# Book Description This introductory book emphasizes algorithms and applications, and is accessible to a broad audience. The author alternates between theory and applications in order to illustrate the mathematics. This second edition includes many new exercises and worked examples, and has been reorganized to improve presentation and clarity of exposition.}

This book is the essential reference guide to using this completely rebuilt version of ANTLR, with its amazing new LL() parsing technology, tree construction facilities, StringTemplate code generation template engine, and sophisticated ANTLRWorks GUI development environment. Learn to use ANTLR directly from the author! ANTLR is a parser generator-a program that generates code to translate a specified input language into a nice, tidy data structure. You might think that parser generators are only used to build compilers. But in fact, programmers usually use parser generators to build translators and interpreters for domain-specific languages such as proprietary data formats, common network protocols, text processing languages, and domain-specific programming languages. Domain-specific languages are important to software development because they represent a more natural, high fidelity, robust, and maintainable means of encoding a problem than simply writing software in a general-purpose language. For example, NASA uses domain-specific command languages for space missions to improve reliability, reduce risk, reduce cost, and increase the speed of development. Even the first Apollo guidance control computer from the 1960s used a domain-specific language that supported vector computations. This book is the definitive guide to using the completely rebuilt ANTLR v3 and describes all features in detail, including the amazing new LL() parsing technology, tree construction facilities, StringTemplate code generation template engine, and sophisticated ANTLRWorks GUI development environment. You'll learn all about ANTLR grammar syntax, resolving grammar ambiguities, parser fault tolerance and error reporting, embedding actions to interpret or translate languages, building intermediate-form trees, extracting information from trees, generating source code, and how to use the ANTLR Java API.}

This immensely practical and thorough book has been written for engineers and scientists in a wide variety of fields, with the goal of explaining DSP techniques while avoiding the barriers of abstract theory and detailed mathematics, enabling readers to put the powerful tools of DSP to work in their research and designs. All techniques are explained through analogies, not simply proven to be true through mathematical derivations. The math is included where it is needed, but it is not used as the primary means of conveying the information. The illustrations are profuse and help to support the text in creative ways. Numerous detailed applications examples from many fields bring the theory to life. The coverage is thorough, detailed, and enlightening. The accompanying CD-ROM contains all the computer code from the 40+ programs used in the applications examples, along with DSP software tools and info from various DSP manufacturers.

Thomas Cormen is Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College. Charles Leiserson is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at MIT. Ronald L. Rivest is Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. Clifford Stein is Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University. \#\#\# About the Author Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called "Divide-and-Conquer"), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many new exercises and problems have been added for this edition. As of the third edition, this textbook is published exclusively by the MIT Press.

If your application has this type of functionality, you can benefit from using AspectJ, an AOP language that is a seamless extension to Java. In this code-intensive book, the authors present a detailed overview of the concepts of AOP and AspectJ, and take you step-by-step through the process of building an application. Along the way, you’ll learn how to adopt AspectJ and use it with your current software development tools and processes. You’ll also learn best practices for application design and documentation using UML. The perfect tool for Java and J2EE developers, this book also includes: * Comprehensive description of the AspectJ language * Best practices for refactoring your existing applications * How to implement classic OO design patterns more cleanly with AspectJ * Tips for debugging with AspectJ The companion Web site contains all sample code, the fully functional application created by the author, and links to relevant sites. \#\#\# About the Author JOSEPH D. GRADECKI is a senior software engineer working on enterprise-level securities processing systems. He has been using AspectJ since the beginning and has built numerous dynamic, enterprise applications using Java, MySQL, servlets, JSPs, Resin, XML, and more.

This second edition has been updated to cover the latest and greatest features of the ever-evolving XML standard. It includes coverage of the final XML Schemas recommendation and the latest developments of XSL. The book is quite suitable for anyone with basic HTML knowledge. The book steps its way through all the key topics–namespaces, models, transformations, formatting, etc.–with a style that keeps you engaged in what each topic looks like in real code, versus in theory. Plenty of notes and cautions highlight important points and pitfalls. There is an excellent presentation of how XML can be used to render formatted HTML using Cascading Style Sheets and XSL–one of the first areas many developers want to tackle when wading into the XML universe. Advanced topics such as SOAP and three-tier architectures are presented, albeit only at a level of detail sufficient to familiarize you with the concepts. *XML by Example* is an excellent place to start to learn XML and a strong preparatory text for more extensive reading on the subject. *–Stephen W.

Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must.The second edition is updated with the addition of two new chapters, 10 color plates, and a new foreword by renowned geographer H. J. de Blij. One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps.To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color."Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space."—Scientific American"A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted. It shows how map makers translate abstract data into eye-catching cartograms, as they are called. It combats cartographic illiteracy. It fights cartophobia. It may even teach you to find your way. For that alone, it seems worthwhile."—Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times". . . witty examination of how and why maps lie. {[}The book] conveys an important message about how statistics of any kind can be manipulated. But it also communicates much of the challenge, aesthetic appeal, and sheer fun of maps. Even those who hated geography in grammar school might well find a new enthusiasm for the subject after reading Monmonier's lively and surprising book."—Wilson Library Bulletin"A reading of this book will leave you much better defended against cheap atlases, shoddy journalism, unscrupulous advertisers, predatory special-interest groups, and others who may use or abuse maps at your expense."—John Van Pelt, Christian Science Monitor"Monmonier meets his goal admirably. . . . {[}His] book should be put on every map user's 'must read' list. It is informative and readable . . . a big step forward in helping us to understand how maps can mislead their readers."—Jeffrey S. Murray, Canadian Geographic}

Lawler, Software Engineering Notes "The book offers a conceptual perspective on several sub-areas of complexity theory and is intended to be used as a textbook for students and educators as well as for experts who seek an overview of of several sub-areas." Gerhard Lischke, Mathematical Reviews \#\#\# Book Description This book offers a conceptual introduction to the study of the intrinsic complexity of computational tasks. It is intended to serve advanced undergraduate and graduate students, either as a textbook or for self-study. It is also useful to experts, since it provides expositions of the various sub-areas of complexity theory such as hardness amplification, pseudorandomness, and probabilistic proof systems.}

Standards are emerging to meet the demands for cryptographic protection in most areas of data communications. Public-key cryptographic techniques are now in widespread use, especially in the financial services industry, in the public sector, and by individuals for their personal privacy, such as in electronic mail. This Handbook will serve as a valuable reference for the novice as well as for the expert who needs a wider scope of coverage within the area of cryptography.

Applications of this technology include detailed inventories of land use parcels. Spatial patterns of disease, geodemographics, environmental management and macroscale inventories of global resources.The impetus for this book is the relative lack of research into the integration of spatial analysis and GIS, and the potential benefits in developing such an integration. From a GIS perspective, there is an increasing demand for systems that do something other than display and organize data. From a spatial analytical perspective, there are advantages to linking statistical methods and mathematical models to the database and display capabilities of a GIS. Although the GIS may not be absolutely necessary for spatial analysis, it can facilitate such an analysis and moreover provide insights that might otherwise have been missed.The contributions to the book tell us where we are and where we ought to be going. It suggests that the integration of spatial analysis and GIS will stimulate interest in quantitative spatial science, particularly exploratory and visual types of analysis and represents a unique statement of the state-of-the-art issues in integration and interface.}

An optional chapter on the quantum algorithm for factoring provides a unique peephole into this exciting topic. In addition to the text, DasGupta also offers a Solutions Manual, which is available on the Online Learning Center.""Algorithms" is an outstanding undergraduate text, equally informed by the historical roots and contemporary applications of its subject.

There is a short and elementary overview introducing the reader to the concept of coding. Then, following the main results, the channel and source coding theorems, there is a study of specific coding schemes which can be used for channel and source coding. This volume can be used either for self-study, or for a graduate/undergraduate level course at university. It includes dozens of worked examples and several hundred problems for solution. The exposition will be easily comprehensible to readers with some prior knowledge of probability and linear algebra. Previous Edition Hb (2002): 0-521-00095-5}

"Introduction to Algorithms" combines rigor and comprehensiveness.The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became the standard reference for professionals and a widely used text in universities worldwide. The second edition features new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming, as well as extensive revisions to virtually every section of the book. In a subtle but important change, loop invariants are introduced early and used throughout the text to prove algorithm correctness. Without changing the mathematical and analytic focus, the authors have moved much of the mathematical foundations material from Part I to an appendix and have included additional motivational material at the beginning.}

  note = {A concise, down-to-earth guide to creating maps using GIS, this book is visually engaging, clear, and compelling–exactly how an effective map should be. Featuring over 300 maps and other figures, including instructive examples of both good and poor design choices, the book covers everything from locating and processing data to making decisions about layout, map symbols, color, and type. For students, professionals, and others who want to make better maps, this is an essential, uniquely helpful resource. The author's website (http://makingmaps.owu.edu) offers excerpts from each chapter, links to related sites, and a regularly updated blog on the topic of making maps. \#\#\# Review "This detailed guide to elementary mapping in the age of digital information, Internet resources, and geographic information systems is simple, clear, and comprehensive. The book's lucid style and dramatic, apposite, and often funny illustrations make it a novel and effective resource in a culture where the map is a ubiquitous presence. More than an instruction manual on making maps, it is also a guide to their critical reading and interpretation. Making Maps will be invaluable for users as well as creators of maps at the university level and beyond."–Denis Cosgrove, Department of Geography, University of California, Los Angeles "Although it looks deceptively simple–like the textbook equivalent of a graphic novel–*Making Maps* condenses all the essential principles of map making and the geographic concepts behind them into a remarkably accessible, witty, engaging book. The text is crystal clear and irreverent, the hundreds of illustrations inspiring and memorable. Only Krygier and Wood, two of the most creative geographers on the planet, could come up with this breakthrough visualization of the art and science of making good maps. Novice and even experienced cartographers will find it an indispensable guide."–Anne Knowles, Department of Geography, Middlebury College "A unique and timely book that provides much-needed guidance to GIS users making thematic maps. One strength of the book is that principles of map design are often best shown by visual example, and another is that the examples are not tied to any one GIS software package. Cartographically sound and very approachable, this book will help readers ensure that the maps they make are clear, legible and easy to understand."–Barbara P. Buttenfield, Department of Geography, University of Colorado, Boulder \#\#\# About the Author John Krygier is a geographer with degrees from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and The Pennsylvania State University. He has extensive experience with map design and production, and has taught mapping and GIS at Penn State, the University of Oregon, The Ohio State University, and the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. He is past president of the North American Cartographic Information Society, and the editor of the journal *Cartographic Perspectives*. He teaches mapping, GIS, and geography at Ohio Wesleyan University, and lives in Columbus, Ohio. Denis Wood curated the Smithsonian’s award-winning Power of Maps exhibition and wrote the bestselling The Power of Maps (Guilford). More recently he has published Seeing Through Maps (ODT) and Five Billion Years of Global Change: A History of the Land (Guilford). He is an independent scholar living in Raleigh, North Carolina.}

  note = {Flexible Neuro-Fuzzy Systems is the first professional literature about the new class of powerful, flexible fuzzy systems. The author incorporates various flexibility parameters to the construction of neuro-fuzzy systems. This approach dramatically improves their performance, allowing the systems to perfectly represent the pattern encoded in data. Flexible Neuro-Fuzzy Systems is the only book that proposes a flexible approach to fuzzy modeling and fills the gap in existing literature. This book introduces new fuzzy systems which outperform previous approaches to system modeling and classification, and has the following features: -Provides a framework for unification, construction and development of neuro-fuzzy systems; -Presents complete algorithms in a systematic and structured fashion, facilitating understanding and implementation, -Covers not only advanced topics but also fundamentals of fuzzy sets, -Includes problems and exercises following each chapter, -Illustrates the results on a wide variety of simulations, -Provides tools for possible applications in business and economics, medicine and bioengineering, automatic control, robotics and civil engineering. \#\#\# Review From the reviews: "This research monograph offers a very detailed insight into ... flexible neurofuzzy architectures. ... The author systematically guides the reader through the essence of the neurofuzzy systems. ... Careful attention to details along with well-organized and systematic derivations of all learning formulas are the important features of the book. The wealth of experimental material and thorough comparative analysis is another strength of the book. The list of references is very much updated ... . Overall, the book is worth studying." (Witold Pedrycz, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1080, 2006) "It is fair to say that the work presented in this book moves the whole area of modeling by neuro-fuzzy systems to a higher level. ... a great resource for researchers in this area, who have a fairly strong background in both fuzzy systems and artificial neural networks. It is also an excellent textbook for advanced graduate students in engineering, systems science, computer science, information science, and perhaps some other areas, who are interested in neuro-fuzzy systems and, more generally, in applications of fuzzy mathematics."

In this illuminating series of case studies, Scrum co-creator and evangelist Ken Schwaber identifies the real-world lessons—the successes and failures—culled from his years of experience coaching companies in agile project management. Through them, you’ll understand how to use Scrum to solve complex problems and drive better results—delivering more valuable software faster.Gain the foundation in Scrum theory—and practice—you need to:Rein in even the most complex, unwieldy projects Effectively manage unknown or changing product requirements Simplify the chain of command with self-managing development teams Receive clearer specifications—and feedback—from customers Greatly reduce project planning time and required tools Build—and release—products in 30-day cycles so clients get deliverables earlier Avoid missteps by regularly inspecting, reporting on, and fine-tuning projects Support multiple teams working on a large-scale project from many geographic locations Maximize return on investment!}

The text is supported by a strong outline. The authors preserve much of the introductory material, but add the latest techniques and developments in data mining, thus making this a comprehensive resource for both beginners and practitioners. The focus is data-all aspects. The presentation is broad, encyclopedic, and comprehensive, with ample references for interested readers to pursue in-depth research on any technique. Summing Up: Highly recommended. Upper-division undergraduates through professionals/practitioners."–**CHOICE** "This interesting and comprehensive introduction to data mining emphasizes the interest in multidimensional data mining–the integration of online analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining. Some chapters cover basic methods, and others focus on advanced techniques. The structure, along with the didactic presentation, makes the book suitable for both beginners and specialized readers."–*ACM's Computing Reviews.com* We are living in the data deluge age. The *Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques* shows us how to find useful knowledge in all that data. Thise 3rd editionThird Edition significantly expands the core chapters on data preprocessing, frequent pattern mining, classification, and clustering. The bookIt also comprehensively covers OLAP and outlier detection, and examines mining networks, complex data types, and important application areas. The book, with its companion website, would make a great textbook for analytics, data mining, and knowledge discovery courses.–*Gregory Piatetsky, President, KDnuggets * Jiawei, Micheline, and Jian give an encyclopaedic coverage of all the related methods, from the classic topics of clustering and classification, to database methods (association rules, data cubes) to more recent and advanced topics (SVD/PCA , wavelets, support vector machines).. Overall, it is an excellent book on classic and modern data mining methods alike, and it is ideal not only for teaching, but as a reference book.-*From the foreword by Christos Faloutsos, Carnegie Mellon University* *"A very good textbook on data mining, this third edition reflects the changes that are occurring in the data mining field. It adds cited material from about 2006, a new section on visualization, and pattern mining with the more recent cluster methods. It's a well-written text, with all of the supporting materials an instructor is likely to want, including Web material support, extensive problem sets, and solution manuals. Though it serves as a data mining text, readers with little experience in the area will find it readable and enlightening. That being said, readers are expected to have some coding experience, as well as database design and statistics analysis knowledge.Two additional items are worthy of note: the text's bibliography is an excellent reference list for mining research; and the index is very complete, which makes it easy to locate information. Also, researchers and analysts from other disciplines–for example, epidemiologists, financial analysts, and psychometric researchers–may find the material very useful."–**Computing Reviews*** *"Han (engineering, U. of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign), Micheline Kamber, and Jian Pei (both computer science, Simon Fraser U., British Columbia) present a textbook for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course introducing data mining. Students should have some background in statistics, database systems, and machine learning and some experience programming. Among the topics are getting to know the data, data warehousing and online analytical processing, data cube technology, cluster analysis, detecting outliers, and trends and research frontiers. Chapter-end exercises are included."**–SciTech Book News*** *"This book is an extensive and detailed guide to the principal ideas, techniques and technologies of data mining. The book is organised in 13 substantial chapters, each of which is essentially standalone, but with useful references to the book's coverage of underlying concepts. A broad range of topics are covered, from an initial overview of the field of data mining and its fundamental concepts, to data preparation, data warehousing, OLAP, pattern discovery and data classification. The final chapter describes the current state of data mining research and active research areas."***–BCS.org****}

It has been shipped with Oracle since at least Version 6 and continues to be supported and enhanced with each new version of Oracle, including Oracle8 and Oracle8i. The job of SQLLoader is to load data from flat files into an Oracle database. It's optimized for loading large volumes of data, and is flexible enough to handle virtually any input format.Almost every Oracle user has to use SQLLoader at one time or another, and DBAs are frequently called upon to load data for the users in their organization. Despite SQLLoader's wide availability and usage, few DBAs and developers know how to get the most out of it. Oracle SQLLoader: The Definitive Guide has everything you need to know to put SQLLoader to its best use: an introduction to SQLLoader, a reference to all of its syntax options, and most importantly, step-by-step instructions for all the SQLLoader tasks you'd want to perform–and maybe some you didn't realize you COULD perform.You'll learn how to construct the necessary control files and load from different types of files containing different types of data (e.g., fixed-width data, delimited data, and data of various datatypes). You'll also learn how to validate data, load it selectively, transform it as it is loaded, and recover after failure. This book explains how to optimize SQLLoader performance by adjusting the transaction size and using the new direct path option. It also covers the newest SQLLoader features–the loading of large object (LOB) columns and the new object types (nested tables, varying arrays, and object tables).Oracle SQLLoader: The Definitive Guide is an indispensable resource for anyone who is new to SQLLoader; a task-oriented learning tool for those who are already using it; and a quick reference for every user. If you want to take best advantage of an essential Oracle tool, you need this book.}

Or have switched jobs to where a different brand of SQL is being used, or maybe even been told to learn SQL yourself? If even one answer is yes, then you need this book. A "Manual of Style" for the SQL programmer, this book is a collection of heuristics and rules, tips, and tricks that will help you improve SQL programming style and proficiency, and for formatting and writing portable, readable, maintainable SQL code. Based on many years of experience consulting in SQL shops, and gathering questions and resolving his students' SQL style issues, Joe Celko can help you become an even better SQL programmer. * Help you write Standard SQL without an accent or a dialect that is used in another programming language or a specific flavor of SQL, code that can be maintained and used by other people. * Enable you to give your group a coding standard for internal use, to enable programmers to use a consistent style. * Give you the mental tools to approach a new problem with SQL as your tool, rather than another programming language - one that someone else might not know! \#\#\# Review "Joe Celko, maybe one of the most prominent representatives of the database community these days, has written some of the best books about SQL programming in general. This book, however, is different. "SQL Programming Style" doesn't teach you how to become a better SQL developer with SQL puzzles and brainteasers. Rather, it shows you "how to work in logical and declarative terms"." - SQL-Server-Performance.com, August 17, 2006 \#\#\# Book Description A collection of heuristics and rules for formatting and writing portable, readable, maintainable SQL code.}

  note = {Praise for "Design Patterns in Ruby"""Design Patterns in Ruby" documents smart ways to resolve many problems that Ruby developers commonly encounter. Russ Olsen has done a great job of selecting classic patterns and augmenting these with newer patterns that have special relevance for Ruby. He clearly explains each idea, making a wealth of experience available to Ruby developers for their own daily work."–Steve Metsker, Managing Consultant with Dominion Digital, Inc."This book provides a great demonstration of the key 'Gang of Four' design patterns without resorting to overly technical explanations. Written in a precise, yet almost informal style, this book covers enough ground that even those without prior exposure to design patterns will soon feel confident applying them using Ruby. Olsen has done a great job to make a book about a classically 'dry' subject into such an engaging and even occasionally humorous read."–Peter Cooper"This book renewed my interest in understanding patterns after a decade of good intentions. Russ picked the most useful patterns for Ruby and introduced them in a straightforward and logical manner, going beyond the GoF's patterns. This book has improved my use of Ruby, and encouraged me to blow off the dust covering the GoF book."–Mike Stok""Design Patterns in Ruby" is a great way for programmers from statically typed objectoriented languages to learn how design patterns appear in a more dynamic, flexible language like Ruby."–Rob Sanheim, Ruby Ninja, RelevanceMost design pattern books are based on C++ and Java. But Ruby is different–and the language's unique qualities make design patterns easier to implement and use. In this book, Russ Olsen demonstrates how to combine Ruby's power and elegance with patterns, and write more sophisticated, effective software with far fewer lines of code.After reviewing the history, concepts, and goals of design patterns, Olsen offers a quick tour of the Ruby language–enough to allow any experienced software developer to immediately utilize patterns with Ruby. The book especially calls attention to Ruby features that simplify the use of patterns, including dynamic typing, code closures, and "mixins" for easier code reuse.Fourteen of the classic "Gang of Four" patterns are considered from the Ruby point of view, explaining what problems each pattern solves, discussing whether traditional implementations make sense in the Ruby environment, and introducing Ruby-specific improvements. You'll discover opportunities to implement patterns in just one or two lines of code, instead of the endlessly repeated boilerplate that conventional languages often require."Design Patterns in Ruby" also identifies innovative new patterns that have emerged from the Ruby community. These include ways to create custom objects with metaprogramming, as well as the ambitious Rails-based "Convention Over Configuration" pattern, designed to help integrate entire applications and frameworks.Engaging, practical, and accessible, "Design Patterns in Ruby" will help you build better software while making your Ruby programming experience more rewarding.}

  note = {Knowledge of number theory and abstract algebra are pre-requisites for any engineer designing a secure internet-based system. However, most of the books currently available on the subject are aimed at practitioners who just want to know how the various tools available on the market work and what level of security they impart. These books traditionally deal with the science and mathematics only in so far as they are necessary to understand how the tools work. Internet Security differs by its assertion that cryptography is the single most important technology for securing the Internet. To quote one reviewer "if every one of your communication partners were using a secure system based on encryption, viruses, worms and hackers would have a very hard time". This scenario does not reflect the reality of the Internet world as it currently stands. However, with security issues becoming more and more important internationally, engineers of the future will be required to design tougher, safer systems. Internet Security: * Offers an in-depth introduction to the relevant cryptographic principles, algorithms protocols - the nuts and bolts of creating a secure network * Links cryptographic principles to the technologies in use on the Internet, eg. PGP, S/MIME, IPsec, SSL TLS, Firewalls and SET (protecting credit card transactions) * Provides state-of-the-art analysis of the latest IETF standards plus summaries and explanations of RFC documents * Authored by a recognised expert in security Internet Security is the definitive text for graduate students on security and cryptography courses, and researchers in security and cryptography areas. It will prove to be invaluable to professionals engaged in the long-term development of secure systems. \#\#\# From the Back Cover Cryptography is the key to securing the Internet If every communication network were to use a secure system based on encryption, then viruses, worms and hackers would have a very hard time. Unfortunately, this scenario does not reflect the reality of the Internet world today. However, with security issues becoming more and more important internationally, engineers of the future will be required to design tougher, safer systems. This book takes a long-term view. It is not a 'how-to' implementation guide for today's practitioners. It is a training text for the engineers of the future. Features: * Detailed discussion of block cipher design principles, including coverage of IDEA, RC5, RC6, Triple DES and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) * Information on hash functions and message digests, including the latest protocols for digital signature, authentication and key-sharing HMAC. * Expanded coverage of public-key encryption/signature algorithms, including Diffie-Hellman secret key exchange, RSA, ElGamal, Schnorr, DSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) * Profiles for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) * Complete and detailed guides to the entire TCP/IP protocol suite * IPsec for network-layer security * PGP and S/MIME for e-mail security * SSL/TLS for transport-layer security * Firewalls for trusted systems * SET security protocols used in the smart card As well as providing an in-depth introduction to relevant cryptographic principles, algorithms and protocols, Internet Security links them to the technologies in use on the Internet today. State-of-the-art analyses of IETF standards plus summaries and explanations of RFC documents, numerous examples and a list of frequently used acronyms make this book a comprehensive and valuable reference for students, researchers and professional engineers alike - anyone engaged in the long-term development of secure systems.}

  note = {Parsing, also referred to as syntax analysis, has been and continues to be an essential part of computer science and linguistics. Today, parsing techniques are also implemented in a number of other disciplines, including but not limited to, document preparation and conversion, typesetting chemical formulae, and chromosome recognition.This second edition presents new developments and discoveries that have been made in the field. Parsing techniques have grown considerably in importance, both in computational linguistics where such parsers are the only option, and computer science, where advanced compilers often use general CF parsers. Parsing techniques provide a solid basis for compiler construction and contribute to all existing software: enabling Web browsers to analyze HTML pages and PostScript printers to analyze PostScript. Some of the more advanced techniques are used in code generation in compilers and in data compression.In linguistics, the importance of formal grammars was recognized early on, but only recently have the corresponding parsing techniques been applied. Also their importance as general pattern recognizers is slowly being acknowledged. This text Parsing Techniques explores new developments, such as generalized deterministic parsing, linear-time substring parsing, parallel parsing, parsing as intersection, non-canonical methods, and non-Chomsky systems.To provide readers with low-threshold access to the full field of parsing techniques, this new edition uses a two-tiered structure. The basic ideas behind the dozen or so existing parsing techniques are explained in an intuitive and narrative style, and problems are presented at the conclusion of each chapter, allowing the reader to step outside the bounds of the covered material and explore parsing techniques at various levels. The reader is also provided with an extensive annotated bibliography as well as hints and partial solutions to a number of problems. In the bibliography, hundreds of realizations and improvements of parsing techniques are explained in a much terser, yet still informal, style, improving its readability and usability.The reader should have an understanding of algorithmic thinking, especially recursion; however, knowledge of any particular programming language is not required.}

  note = {Genetic programming may be more powerful than neural networks and other machine learning techniques, able to solve problems in a wider range of disciplines. In this ground-breaking book, John Koza shows how this remarkable paradigm works and provides substantial empirical evidence that solutions to a great variety of problems from many different fields can be found by genetically breeding populations of computer programs. Genetic Programming contains a great many worked examples and includes a sample computer code that will allow readers to run their own programs.In getting computers to solve problems without being explicitly programmed, Koza stresses two points: that seemingly different problems from a variety of fields can be reformulated as problems of program induction, and that the recently developed genetic programming paradigm provides a way to search the space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program to solve the problems of program induction. Good programs are found by evolving them in a computer against a fitness measure instead of by sitting down and writing them.John R. Koza is Consulting Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. \#\#\# Review The research reported in this book is a tour de force. For the first time, since the idea was bandied about in the '40s and early '50s, we have a non-trivial, nontailored set of examples of automatic programming."

Although written as a text for an advanced undergraduate course in theoretical computer science, the book may serve as an introductory resource, or the foundation for independent study, in many areas of theoretical computing: grammars, automata theory, computability, complexity theory, and unsolvability. The beauty of this book is that the breadth of coverage is complemented with extraordinary depth." -CHOICE "Theoretical computer science is often viewed as a collection of disparate topics, including computability theory, formal language theory, complexity theory, logic, and so on. This well-written book attempts to unify the subject by introducing each of these topics in turn, then showing how they relate to each other... This is an excellent book that succeeds in tying together a number of areas in theoretical computer science." -COMPUTING REVIEWS \#\#\# From the Back Cover This book is a rigorous but readable introduction to some of the central topics in theoretical computer science. The main subjects are computability theory, formal languages, logic and automated deduction, computational complexity (including NP-completeness), and programming language semantics.}

With OpenGL ES 2.0, the full programmability of shaders is now available on small and portable devices—including cell phones, PDAs, consoles, appliances, and vehicles. However, OpenGL ES differs significantly from OpenGL. Graphics programmers and mobile developers have had very little information about it—until now. In the OpenGL® ES 2.0 Programming Guide, three leading authorities on the Open GL ES 2.0 interface—including the specification’s editor—provide start-to-finish guidance for maximizing the interface’s value in a wide range of high-performance applications. The authors cover the entire API, including Khronos-ratified extensions. Using detailed C-based code examples, they demonstrate how to set up and program every aspect of the graphics pipeline. You’ll move from introductory techniques all the way to advanced per-pixel lighting, particle systems, and performance optimization. Coverage includes: Shaders in depth: creating shader objects, compiling shaders, checking for compile errors, attaching shader objects to program objects, and linking final program objects The OpenGL ES Shading Language: variables, types, constructors, structures, arrays, attributes, uniforms, varyings, precision qualifiers, and invariance Inputting geometry into the graphics pipeline, and assembling geometry into primitives Vertex shaders, their special variables, and their use in per-vertex lighting, skinning, and other applications Usingfragment shaders—including examples of multitexturing, fog, alpha test, and user clip planes Fragment operations: scissor test, stencil test, depth test, multisampling, blending, and dithering Advanced rendering: per-pixel lighting with normal maps, environment mapping, particle systems, image post-processing, and projective texturing Real-world programming challenges: platform diversity, C++ portability, OpenKODE, and platform-specific shader binaries}

You'll discover practical ways to gather user stories, even when you can't speak with your users. Then, once you've compiled your user stories, Cohn shows how to organize them, prioritize them, and use them for planning, management, and testing. User role modeling: understanding what users have in common, and where they differ Gathering stories: user interviewing, questionnaires, observation, and workshops Working with managers, trainers, salespeople and other "proxies" Writing user stories for acceptance testing Using stories to prioritize, set schedules, and estimate release costs Includes end-of-chapter practice questions and exercises User Stories Applied will be invaluable to every software developer, tester, analyst, and manager working with any agile method: XP, Scrum... or even your own home-grown approach.ADDISON-WESLEY PROFESSIONALBoston, MA 02116www.awprofessional.comISBN: 0-321-20568-5}

Watson** was Director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory from 1968 to 1993, President from 1994 to 2003, and is now its Chancellor. He spent his undergraduate years at the University of Chicago and received his Ph.D. in 1950 from Indiana University. Between 1950 and 1953, he did postdoctoral research in Copenhagen and Cambridge, England. While at Cambridge, he began the collaboration that resulted in the elucidation of the double-helical structure of DNA in 1953. (For this discovery, Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962.) Later in 1953, he went to the California Institute of Technology. He moved to Harvard in 1955, where he taught and did research on RNA synthesis and protein synthesis until 1976. He was the first Director of the National Center for Genome Research of the National Institutes of Health from 1989 to 1992. Dr. Watson was sole author of the first, second, and third editions of **Molecular Biology of the Gene**, and a co-author of the fourth and fifth editions. These were published in 1965, 1970, 1976, 1987, and 2003, respectively. He is also a co-author of two other textbooks: **Molecular Biology of the Cell and Recombinant DNA**. * * * **Tania A. Baker** is the Whitehead Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She received a B.S. in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Stanford University in 1988. Her graduate research was carried out in the laboratory of Professor Arthur Kornberg and focused on mechanisms of initiation of DNA replication. She did postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Dr. Kiyoshi Mizuuchi at the National Institutes of Health, studying the mechanism and regulation of DNA transposition. Her current research explores mechanisms and regulation of genetic recombination, enzyme-catalyzed protein unfolding, and ATP-dependent protein degradation. Professor Baker received the 2001 Eli Lilly Research Award from the American Society of Microbiology and the 2000 MIT School of Science Teaching Prize for Undergraduate Education and was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2004. She is co-author (with Arthur Kornberg) of the book **DNA Replication**, Second Edition. * * * **Stephen P.

  note = {Artificial neural networks can mimic the biological information-processing mechanism in - a very limited sense. Fuzzy logic provides a basis for representing uncertain and imprecise knowledge and forms a basis for human reasoning. Neural networks display genuine promise in solving problems, but a definitive theoretical basis does not yet exist for their design.Fusion of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems and Genetic Algorithms integrates neural net, fuzzy system, and evolutionary computing in system design that enables its readers to handle complexity - offsetting the demerits of one paradigm by the merits of another.This book presents specific projects where fusion techniques have been applied. The chapters start with the design of a new fuzzy-neural controller. Remaining chapters discuss the application of expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy control, and evolutionary computing techniques in modern engineering systems. These specific applications include: direct frequency converterselectro-hydraulic systemsmotor controltoaster controlspeech recognitionvehicle routingfault diagnosisAsynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) communications networkstelephones for hard-of-hearing peoplecontrol of gas turbine aero-enginestelecommunications systems designFusion of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems and Genetic Algorithms covers the spectrum of applications - comprehensively demonstrating the advantages of fusion techniques in industrial applications.}

  volume = {1},

  date = {2001-01},
  note = {PHP and MySQL are popular open-source technologies that are ideal for quickly developing database-driven Web applications. PHP is a powerful scripting language designed to enable developers to create highly featured Web applications quickly, and MySQL is a fast, reliable database that integrates well with PHP and is suited for dynamic Internet-based applications. *PHP and MySQL Web Development* shows how to use these tools together to produce effective, interactive Web applications. It clearly describes the basics of the PHP language, explains how to set up and work with a MySQL database, and then shows how to use PHP to interact with the database and the server. This practical, hands-on book includes numerous examples that demonstrate common tasks such as authenticating users, constructing a shopping cart, generating PDF documents and images dynamically, sending and managing email, facilitating user discussions, connecting to Web services using XML, and developing Web 2.0 applications with Ajax-based interactivity. The fourth edition of *PHP and MySQL Web Development* has been thoroughly updated, revised, and expanded to cover developments in PHP 5 through version 5.3, such as namespaces and closures, as well as features introduced in MySQL 5.1. \#\#\# Review “This book by Welling \& Thomson is the only one which I have found to be indispensable. The writing is clear and straightforward but never wastes my time.The book is extremely well laid out.The chapters are the right length and chapter titles quickly take you where you want to go.” —Wright Sullivan, President,A\&E Engineering, Inc., Greer South Carolina “There are several good introductory books on PHP, but Welling \& Thomson is an excellent handbook for those who wish to build up complex and reliable systems. It’s obvious that the authors have a strong background in the development of professional applications and they teach not only the language itself, but also how to use it with good software engineering practices.” —Javier Garcia, senior telecom engineer, Telefonica R\&D Labs, Madrid “This book rocks! I am an experienced programmer, so I didn’t need a lot of help with PHP syntax; after all, it’s very close to C/C++. I don’t know a thing about databases, though, so when I wanted to develop a book review engine (among other projects) I wanted a solid reference to using MySQL with PHP. I have O’Reilly’s mSQL and MySQL book, and it’s probably a better pure-SQL reference, but this book has earned a place on my reference shelf...Highly recommended.” —Paul Robichaux “The true PHP/MySQL bible, PHP and MySQL Web Development by Luke Welling and Laura Thomson, made me realize that programming and databases are now available to the commoners. Again, I know 1/10000th of what there is to know, and already I’m enthralled.” —Tim Luoma,TnTLuoma.com \#\#\# About the Author **Lead Authors** ** ** **Laura Thomson **is a senior software engineer at Mozilla Corporation.

  note = {This comprehensive guide shows you how to master the most important changes to Java since it was first released. Generics and the greatly expanded collection libraries have tremendously increased the power of Java 5 and Java 6. But they have also confused many developers who haven't known how to take advantage of these new features.Java Generics and Collections covers everything from the most basic uses of generics to the strangest corner cases. It teaches you everything you need to know about the collections libraries, so you'll always know which collection is appropriate for any given task, and how to use it. Topics covered include:Fundamentals of generics: type parameters and generic methods Other new features: boxing and unboxing, foreach loops, varargs Subtyping and wildcards Evolution not revolution: generic libraries with legacy clients and generic clients with legacy libraries Generics and reflection Design patterns for generics Sets, Queues, Lists, Maps, and their implementations Concurrent programming and thread safety with collections Performance implications of different collections Generics and the new collection libraries they inspired take Java to a new level. If you want to take your software development practice to a new level, this book is essential reading.Philip Wadler is Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh, where his research focuses on the design of programming languages. He is a co-designer of GJ, work that became the basis for generics in Sun's Java 5.0.Maurice Naftalin is Technical Director at Morningside Light Ltd., a software consultancy in the United Kingdom. He has most recently served as an architect and mentor at NSB Retail Systems plc, and as the leader of the client development team of a major UK government social service system."A brilliant exposition of generics. By far the best book on the topic, it provides a crystal clear tutorial that starts with the basics and ends leaving the reader with a deep understanding of both the use and design of generics."

This text explores the formal underpinnings ofobject-oriented languages to help the reader understand the fundamental concepts ofthese languages and the design decisions behind them.The text begins by analyzingexisting object-oriented languages, paying special attention to their type systemsand impediments to expressiveness. It then examines two key features: subtypes andsubclasses. After a brief introduction to the lambda calculus, it presents aprototypical object-oriented language, SOOL, with a simple type system similar tothose of class-based object-oriented languages in common use. The text offers proofthat the type system is sound by showing that the semantics preserves typinginformation. It concludes with a discussion of desirable features, such asparametric polymorphism and a MyType construct, that are not yet included in moststatically typed object-oriented languages.}

The chances are good that your application's database layer already contains problems such as Index Shotgun, Keyless Entry, Fear of the Unknown, and Spaghetti Query. This book will help you and your team find them. Even better, it will also show you how to fix them, and how to avoid these and other problems in the future. SQL Antipatterns gives you a rare glimpse into an SQL expert's playbook. Now you can stamp out these common database errors once and for all. Whatever platform or programming language you use, whether you're a junior programmer or a Ph.D., SQL Antipatterns will show you how to design and build databases, how to write better database queries, and how to integrate SQL programming with your application like an expert. You'll also learn the best and most current technology for full-text search, how to design code that is resistant to SQL injection attacks, and other techniques for success.}

  volume = {1},
  author = {Allen, Mitch},
  date = {2009-08},
  note = {A Note from the Author and from O'Reilly Media about what this book does–and doesn't–do: Palm webOS is a brand new platform and represents a very different type of operating system where the web runtime is used as the basis for the UI and Application model. Palm and O'Reilly felt that it was important to have a book available to help developers get a basic understanding of the new Palm platform at the time that the SDK was released; this timing played a major role in the content and structure of the book. Ideally this book would have been a complete reference of the new platform but that wasn't possible since the content was written at the same time as the software SDK was being developed by the Palm engineering team. The book does provide a complete overview of Palm webOS, a thorough description of the application model and gives details on many key design concepts. There are descriptions and examples of UI widgets, services, storage, notifications, dashboards and background applications, serving as a great introduction but not as a definitive source. The book uses a simple News reader application to illustrate the technical descriptions but the examples are not intended to serve as a cookbook tutorial. Experienced developers should be able to use the examples to build up a working application chapter by chapter but others may not find the loose descriptions adequate for recreating the application unaided. Over time, these different needs will be filled by other books, but in the meantime we hope that this book will serve a valuable role introducing developers to webOS and giving them a way of getting started with webOS application development. A second printing of the book will update any original coverage obsoleted by subsequent Mojo SDK builds. For owners of the original printing of the book, all of these updates are posted on the "View/Submit Errata" link (please see left-hand column of this web page). Thanks for understanding that book publishing and coverage of rapidly moving technologies can sometimes be an inexact science; we knew there'd be a need for a book such as *Palm webOS: The Insider's Guide to Developing Applications in JavaScript using the Palm MojoT Framework*, and there's certainly no better person to write that book that Mitch Allen; that said, we understand that because it is such a new operating system and SDK, there would (and will continue to be) changes that at best can't be documented and explored until new printings of the books are released. In the meantime we will be diligent in posting updates to this book's O'Reilly Media catalog page. Description This is the official guide to building native JavaScript applications for Palm's new mobile operating system, Palm® webOSTM. Written by Palm's software chief technology officer along with the Palm webOS development team, *Palm webOS* provides a complete tutorial on the design principles, architecture, UI, tools, and services necessary to develop webOS applications-including the Mojo JavaScript framework and Palm's SDK. Palm webOS is designed to support a fast and superb user experience using established web standards, so if you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you're ready to build applications for any webOS-based device, including the Palm Pre. You'll gain expertise, chapter by chapter, as you build a working mobile application through the course of the book. You'll also learn how to extend existing web apps to work with the new generation of mobile phones. * Get a thorough overview of the webOS platform and architecture * Understand the critical concepts for application design: what separates webOS from other web and mobile platforms * Learn the details of Mojo's development tools and SDK for building and testing mobile applications * Examine best practices, important considerations, and guiding principles for developing with webOS and the Mojo framework \#\#\# About the Author Mitch Allen is CTO of Software at Palm, Inc. where he has worked in various positions for 8 years starting with building and leading the software team at Handspring which conceived and developed the Treo smartphone. From webOS's conception to implementation, Mitch designed the early architecture of the webOS platform and led the development team through the initial design stage and as a result is intimately familiar with the capabilities of the platform and tools. He is currently leading the design of the developer SDK and toolsets, and working with initial developers in their use of the platform and SDK. Previously, Mitch worked at Apple, after 15 years developing image and text processing systems at Kodak and Agfa Compugraphic. He holds a degree in Math and Computer Science from the University of New Hampshire.}

Revised to address the latest version of MINIX (MINIX 3), this streamlined, simplified new edition remains the only operating systems text to first explain relevant principles, then demonstrate their applications using a Unix-like operating system as a detailed example. It has been especially designed for high reliability, for use in embedded systems, and for ease of teaching. \#\#\# From the Publisher This book offers a unique and carefully integrated combination of principles and practice. While the usual principles are covered in detail, the book also describes a small, but real UNIX-like operating system: MINIX. It shows how it works and illustrates the principles behind it. By using MINIX, students learn principles and then can apply them in hands-on system design projects. \#\#\# From the Back Cover “The presentation is excellent. The book should be on the desk of any serious student of operating systems.”*–Dr. Samuel Kohn, **Thomas **Edison **State** College* “I would give the authors very high grades for their writing style. Topics are explained in a clear and understandable manner. Presentations are well organized and they flow in logical fashion. The book provides the right depth and breadth of explanations with the appropriate amount of rigor and abstraction.” *–Gojko Babic, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, **Ohio **State **University* ***The definitive, up-to-date introduction to operating systems: *** ***Core principles plus hands-on examples with the new MINIX 3 operating system*** The world’s best-selling introductory operating systems text has been thoroughly updated to reflect the latest advances in OS design and implementation. Offering an optimal balance of theory and practice, *Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, Third Edition* remains the best resource for anyone seeking a deep understanding of how operating systems work. This edition includes MINIX 3, more compact, more reliable, better suited for embedded applications – and, above all, *even* *easier to teach and learn from. *Using MINIX, the authors introduce virtually every core concept needed to construct a working OS: system calls, processes, IPC, scheduling, I/O, deadlocks, memory management, threads, file systems, security, and more. **NEW TO THIS EDITION** · Newly-released, significantly-improved MINIX 3 operating system on CD-ROM: giving students hands-on experience in modifying and rebuilding a contemporary operating system · Expanded and reorganized coverage of processes and communication · Revised and enhanced coverage of CPU scheduling, deadlocks, file system reliability, and security · Includes more than 150 end of chapter problems ** ** · **ABOUT THE AUTHORS** **Andrew S.

This is a deeply technical book and focuses on the software engineering skills to ace your interview. The book is over 500 pages and includes **150 programming interview questions and answers**, as well as other advice. The full list of topics are as follows: * * * **The Interview Process** This section offers an overview on questions are selected and how you will be evaluated. What happens when you get a question wrong? When should you start preparing, and how? What language should you use? All these questions and more are answered. * * * **Behind the Scenes** Learn what happens behind the scenes during your interview, how decisions really get made, who you interview with, and what they ask you. Companies covered include Google, Amazon, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook. * * * **Special Situations** This section explains the process for experience candidates, Program Managers, Dev Managers, Testers / SDETs, and more. Learn what your interviewers are looking for and how much code you need to know. **Before the Interview** In order to ace the interview, you first need to get an interview. This section describes what a software engineer's resume should look like and what you should be doing well before your interview. **Behavioral Preparation** Although most of a software engineering interview will be technical, behavioral questions matter too. This section covers how to prepare for behavioral questions and how to give strong, structured responses. **Technical Questions (+ 5 Algorithm Approaches)** This section covers how to prepare for technical questions (without wasting your time) and teaches actionable ways to solve the trickiest algorithm problems. It also teaches you what exactly "good coding" is when it comes to an interview. **150 Programming Questions and Answers** This section forms the bulk of the book. Each section opens with a discussion of the core knowledge and strategies to tackle this type of question, diving into exactly how you break down and solve it. Topics covered include * Arrays and Strings * Linked Lists * Stacks and Queues * Trees and Graphs * Bit Manipulation * Brain Teasers * Mathematics and Probability * Object-Oriented Design * Recursion and Dynamic Programming * Sorting and Searching * Scalability and Memory Limits * Testing * C and C++ * Java * Databases * Threads and Locks For the widest degree of readability, the solutions are almost entirely written with Java (with the exception of C / C++ questions). A link is provided with the book so that you can download, compile, and play with the solutions yourself. *Changes from the Fourth Edition: *The fifth edition includes over 200 pages of new content, bringing the book from 300 pages to over 500 pages. Major revisions were done to almost every solution, including a number of alternate solutions added. The introductory chapters were massively expanded, as were the opening of each of the chapters under Technical Questions. In addition, 24 new questions were added. ***Cracking the Coding Interview, Fifth Edition*** is the most expansive, detailed guide on how to ace your software development / programming interviews. \#\#\# From the Author Gayle Laakmann's interviewing expertise comes from vast experience on both sides of the desk.

  volume = {1},
  author = {FARREL, ADRIAN},
  date = {2004-05},
  note = {The view presented in *The Internet and Its Protocols* is at once broad and deep. It covers all the common protocols and how they combine to create the Internet in its totality. More importantly, it describes each one completely, examining the requirements it addresses and the exact means by which it does its job. These descriptions include message flows, full message formats, and message exchanges for normal and error operation. They are supported by numerous diagrams and tables. This book's comparative approach gives you something more valuable: insight into the decisions you face as you build and maintain your network, network device, or network application. Author Adrian Farrel's experience and advice will dramatically smooth your path as you work to offer improved performance and a wider range of services. * Provides comprehensive, in-depth, and comparative coverage of the Internet Protocol (both IPv4 and IPv6) and its many related technologies. * Written for developers, operators, and managers, and designed to be used as both an overview and a reference. * Discusses major concepts in traffic engineering, providing detailed looks at MPLS and GMPLS and how they control both IP and non-IP traffic. * Covers protocols for governing routing and transport, and for managing switches, components, and the network as a whole, along with higher-level application protocols. * Offers thoughtful guidance on choosing between protocols, selecting features within a protocol, and other service- and performance-related decisions. \#\#\# Review "Not only is this book thorough in covering the networking technologies and the applications of today's communications networks, it also guides you to comprehensive understanding of problems and solutions. This should be mandatory reading for every professional in our business." –Loa Andersson, TLA-group, IETF MPLS working group co-chair. "Before this book, one would need to search through dozens of resources to find such a complete picture of the common Internet protocols. I for one will be keeping a copy of this book on my desk, as well as making this text required reading in the networking courses I teach." –Thomas D. Nadeau, Technical Leader, Cisco Systems, Inc., and Adjunct Professor of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts \#\#\# Book Description Uniquely combines coverage of IP, IP transport, IP control protocols, and notable IP-based applications and management protocols.}

In this text extensive use is made of the Mathematica computer algebra system. No prior knowledge of Mathematica or programming is assumed. This book includes 33 experimental activities that are designed to deepen and broaden the reader's understanding of nonlinear physics. These activities are correlated with Part I, the theoretical framework of the text. \#\#\# Review "This book is a revision of an earlier work that looked at nonlinear physics using MAPLE® software. As with that work, Enns and McGuire incorporate theory, experiment, and numerical applications in a thorough introduction to a wide range of nonlinear topics. ... The book assumes no familiarity with nonlinear physics or MATHEMATICA® . . . The authors do an extraordinary job of integrating application and theory. They provide applications from a variety of disciplines throughout the sections that introduce the theory and that look at methods of analysis and consider the various approaches to addressing nonlinear problems. It is not an exaggeration to say that this book considers all areas of interest in nonlinear analysis with solid introductions. (This reviewer, having taught the basics of nonlinear physics over the last 15 years, wishes he had had this book as a tutor.) Added to this are 33 experimental activities using MATHEMATICA® that demonstrate concepts and applied examples." —Choice Reviewer comments on the Maple edition of NONLINEAR PHYSICS: "An...excellent book...the authors have been able to cover an extraordinary range of topics and hopefully excite a wide audience to investigate nonlinear phenomena...accessible to advanced undergraduates and yet challenging enough for graduate students and working scientists.... The reader is guided through it all with sound advice and humor.... I hope that many will adopt the text." -American Journal of Physics "Its organization of subject matter, clarity of writing, and smooth integration of analytic and computational techniques put it among the very best...Richard Enns and George McGuire have written an excellent text for introductory nonlinear physics." -Computers in Physics "...correctly balances a good treatment of nonlinear, but also nonchaotic, behavior of systems with some of the exciting findings about chaotic dynamics...one of the book's strength is the diverse selection of examples from mechanical, chemical, electronic, fluid and many other systems .... Another strength of the book is the diversity of approaches that the student is encouraged to take...the authors have chosen well, and the trio of text,...software, and lab manual gives the newcomer to nonlinear physics quite an effective set of tools.... Basic ideas are explained clearly and illustrated with many examples." -Physics Today "... the care that the authors have taken to ensure that their text is as comprehensive, versatile, interactive, and student-friendly as possible place this book far above the average." -Scientific Computing World}

Included here are three lectures on problem-solving and a lecture on inertial guidance omitted from *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*. An enlightening memoir by Matthew Sands and oral history interviews with Feynman and his Caltech colleagues provide firsthand accounts of the origins of Feynman's landmark lecture series. Also included are incisive and illuminating exercises originally developed to supplement *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*, by Robert B. Leighton and Rochus E. Vogt. *Feynman's Tips on Physics* was co-authored by Michael A. Gottlieb and Ralph Leighton to provide students, teachers, and enthusiasts alike an opportunity to learn physics from some of its greatest teachers, the creators of *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*. \#\#\# About the Author **Richard P. Feynman** was a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology from 1951 to 1988. He shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on quantum electrodynamics. **Michael A. Gottlieb** is a visitor in physics at the California Institute of Technology, and an editor of *The Feynman Lectures on Physics* and *Exercises for the Feynman Lectures on Physics*. He administers the Feynman Lectures website, feynmanlectures.info. **Ralph Leighton** is an author, lateral thinker, and longtime friend of the late Richard Feynman.}

Introduction to Modern Inorganic Chemistry begins by explaining the electronic structure and properties of atoms, then describes the principles of bonding in diatomic and polyatomic covalent molecules, the solid state, and solution chemistry. Further on in the book, the general properties of the periodic table are studied along with specific elements and groups such as hydrogen, the 's' elements, the lanthanides, the actinides, the transition metals, and the "p" block. Simple and advanced examples are mixed throughout to increase the depth of students' understanding. This edition has a completely new layout including revised artwork, case study boxes, technical notes, and examples. All of the problems have been revised and extended and include notes to assist with approaches and solutions. It is an excellent tool to help students see how inorganic chemistry applies to medicine, the environment, and biological topics.}

  note = {Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB is the first book to offer a balanced treatment of image processing fundamentals and the software principles used in their implementation. The book integrates material from the leading text, Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez and Woods, and the Image Processing Toolbox from The MathWorks, Inc., a leader in scientific computing. The Image Processing Toolbox provides a stable, well-supported software environment for addressing a broad range of applications in digital image processing. A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on showing how to enhance those tools by developing new code. This is important in image processing, an area that normally requires extensive experimental work in order to arrive at acceptable application solutions. Some Highlights: (1) This new edition is an extensive upgrade of the book. (2) Over 120 new MATLAB image processing functions are developed, a 40 \% increase over existing functions in the Image Processing Toolbox. (3) Algorithms and MATLAB functions in the mainstream of digital image processing are discussed and implemented, including: Intensity transformations; spatial filtering; fuzzy image processing; filtering in the frequency domain; image restoration and reconstruction; geometric transformations and image registration; color image processing; wavelets; image and video compression; morphology; image segmentation; image representation and description; and object recognition. (4) In addition to a major revision of the topics from the first edition, features in this edition include new coverage of: The Radon transform; image processing functions based on function-generating functions (function factories); geometric transformations; image registration; color profiles and device-independent color conversions; functions for video compression; adaptive thresholding algorithms; new image features, including minimum-perimeter polygons and local (corner) features.}

The author explains SQL, the space of execution plans for answering SQL queries, query optimization, how the choice of access paths (e.g., indexes) is crucial to performance, and the complexity of the physical design problem. The second part extensively discusses automated physical design techniques, covering fundamental research ideas in the last 15 years that have resulted in a new generation of tuning tools. The text focuses on the search space of alternatives, the necessity of a cost model to compare such alternatives, different mechanisms to traverse and enumerate the search space, and practical aspects in real-world tuning tools. In the third part, the author explores new advances in automated physical design. He applies previous approaches to other physical structures, such as materialized views, partitioning, and multidimensional clustering. He also analyzes workload models for new types of applications, generalizes the optimizing function of current physical design tools to cope with other application scenarios, and examines open-ended challenges in physical database design. This book offers valuable insights on well-established principles and cutting-edge research results in automated physical design. It helps readers gain a deeper understanding of how automated tuning tools work in database installations as well as the challenges and opportunities involved in designing next-generation tuning tools.}

  note = {Traditional software development methods struggle to keep pace with the accelerated pace and rapid change of Internet-era development. Several "agile methodologies" have been developed in response – and these approaches to software development are showing exceptional promise. In this book, Jim Highsmith covers them all – showing what they have in common, where they differ, and how to choose and customize the best agile approach for your needs. Highsmith begins by introducing the values and principles shared by virtually all agile software development methods. He presents detailed case studies from organizations that have used them, as well as interviews with each method's principal authors or leading practitioners. Next, he takes a closer look at the key features and techniques associated with each major Agile approach: Extreme Programming (XP), Crystal Methods, Scrum, Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Lean Development, Adaptive Software Development (ASD), and Feature-Driven Development (FDD). In Part III, Highsmith offers practical advice on customizing the optimal agile discipline for your own organization. For all software developers, project managers, and other IT professionals seeking more flexible, effective approaches to developing software. \#\#\# From the Back Cover In a highly volatile software development environment, developers must be nimble, responsive, and able to hit a moving target–in short, they must be agile. Agile software development is designed to address this need for speed and flexibility. Agility describes a holistic, collaborative environment in which you can both create and respond to change by focusing on adaptability over predictability, people over process. Agile software development incorporates proven software engineering techniques, but without the overhead and restrictions of traditional development methodologies. Above all, it fulfills its promise of delivering software that serves the client's business needs. Written by one of the leaders of the Agile movement, and including interviews with Agile gurus Kent Beck, Robert Charette, Alistair Cockburn, Martin Fowler, Ken Schwaber, and Ward Cunningham, ***Agile Software Development Ecosystems*** crystallizes the current understanding of this flexible and highly successful approach to software development. It presents the key practices of all Agile development approaches, offers overviews of specific techniques, and shows how you can choose the approach that best suits your organization. This book describes–in depth–the most important principles of Agile development: delivering value to the customer, focusing on individual developers and their skills, collaboration, an emphasis on producing working software, the critical contribution of technical excellence, and a willingness to change course when demands shift. All major Agile methods are presented: * Scrum * Dynamic Systems Development Method * Crystal Methods * Feature-Driven Development * Lean Development * Extreme Programming * Adaptive Software Development Throughout the book, case stories are used to illustrate how Agile practices empower success around the world in today's chaotic software development industry. ***Agile Software Development Ecosystems*** also examines how to determine your organization's Agile readiness, how to design a custom Agile methodology, and how to transform your company into a truly Agile organization. 0201760436B03042002 \#\#\# About the Author **Jim Highsmith** is a well-known consultant, software developer, writer, and speaker.

Winner of the 2009 Textbook Excellence Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association (TAA)! *Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles* is a comprehensive and unified introduction to operating systems. By using several innovative tools, Stallings makes it possible to understand critical core concepts that can be fundamentally challenging. The new edition includes the implementation of web based animations to aid visual learners. At key points in the book, students are directed to view an animation and then are provided with assignments to alter the animation input and analyze the results. The concepts are then enhanced and supported by end-of-chapter case studies of UNIX, Linux and Windows Vista. These provide students with a solid understanding of the key mechanisms of modern operating systems and the types of design tradeoffs and decisions involved in OS design. Because they are embedded into the text as end of chapter material, students are able to apply them right at the point of discussion. This approach is equally useful as a basic reference and as an up-to-date survey of the state of the art. \#\#\# From the Back Cover Blending up-to-date theory with state-of-the-art applications, this book offers a comprehensive treatment of operating systems, with an emphasis on internals and design issues.

Beginning with existing standards and their impact on multimedia image and video processing, experts from around the world address a broad spectrum of topics in a tutorial style. Their authoritative contributions cover the pros and cons of current and new architectures, conventional and intelligent image processing techniques, new developments in the compression and coding of video and images, and content-based image and video retrieval. The book's final chapters examine recent results in multimedia applications, including transcoding for multipoint video conferencing, distance education, video-on-demand and telemedicine. The extremely rapid growth of this field means that books even just a few years old may offer information that is already obsolete. Multimedia Image and Video Processing offers not only recent research and developments, but does so in a way that provides a solid introduction to each topic and builds a basis for future study, research, and development.}

  note = {Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with ***Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship***. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. ***Clean Code*** is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding * How to tell the difference between good and bad code * How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code * How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes * How to format code for maximum readability * How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic * How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code. \#\#\# About the Author **Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin **has been a software professional since 1970 and an international software consultant since 1990. He is founder and president of Object Mentor, Inc., a team of experienced consultants who mentor their clients worldwide in the fields of C++, Java, C\#, Ruby, OO, Design Patterns, UML, Agile Methodologies, and eXtreme programming. \#\#\# Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Which door represents your code? Which door represents your team or your company? Why are we in that room? Is this just a normal code review or have we found a stream of horrible problems shortly after going live? Are we debugging in a panic, poring over code that we thought worked? Are customers leaving in droves and managers breathing down our necks? How can we make sure we wind up behind the *right* door when the going gets tough? The answer is: *craftsmanship*. There are two parts to learning craftsmanship: knowledge and work. You must gain the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics that a craftsman knows, and you must also grind that knowledge into your fingers, eyes, and gut by working hard and practicing. I can teach you the physics of riding a bicycle. Indeed, the classical mathematics is relatively straightforward. Gravity, friction, angular momentum, center of mass, and so forth, can be demonstrated with less than a page full of equations. Given those formulae I could prove to you that bicycle riding is practical and give you all the knowledge you needed to make it work. And you'd still fall down the first time you climbed on that bike. Coding is no different. We could write down all the "feel good" principles of clean code and then trust you to do the work (in other words, let you fall down when you get on the bike), but then what kind of teachers would that make us, and what kind of student would that make you? No. That's not the way this book is going to work. Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. You must watch others practice it and fail. You must see them stumble and retrace their steps. You must see them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for making those decisions the wrong way. Be prepared to work hard while reading this book. This is not a "feel good" book that you can read on an airplane and finish before you land. This book will make you work, and work hard. What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code–lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code and what's wrong with it. You'll be asked to follow along as we take modules apart and put them back together again. This will take time and effort; but we think it will be worth it. We have divided this book into three parts. The first several chapters describe the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. There is quite a bit of code in these chapters, and they will be challenging to read. They'll prepare you for the second section to come. If you put the book down after reading the first section, good luck to you! The second part of the book is the harder work. It consists of several case studies of ever-increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up some code–of transforming code that has some problems into code that has fewer problems. The detail in this section is intense. You will have to flip back and forth between the narrative and the code listings. You will have to analyze and understand the code we are working with and walk through our reasoning for making each change we make. Set aside some time because *this should take you days*. The third part of this book is the payoff. It is a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies. As we walked through and cleaned up the code in the case studies, we documented every reason for our actions as a heuristic or smell. We tried to understand our own reactions to the code we were reading and changing, and worked hard to capture why we felt what we felt and did what we did. The result is a knowledge base that desribes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. This knowledge base is of limited value if you don't do the work of carefully reading through the case studies in the second part of this book. In those case studies we have carefully annotated each change we made with forward references to the heuristics. These forward references appear in square brackets like this: H22. This lets you see the context in which those heuristics were applied and written! It is not the heuristics themselves that are so valuable, it is the *relationship between those heuristics and the discrete decisions we made while cleaning up the code in the case studies*. To further help you with those relationships, we have placed a cross-reference at the end of the book that shows the page number for every forward reference. You can use it to look up each place where a certain heuristic was applied. If you read the first and third sections and skip over the case studies, then you will have read yet another "feel good" book about writing good software. But if you take the time to work through the case studies, following every tiny step, every minute decision–if you put yourself in our place, and force yourself to think along the same paths that we thought, then you will gain a much richer understanding of those principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics. They won't be "feel good" knowledge any more. They'll have been ground into your gut, fingers, and heart. They'll have become part of you in the same way that a bicycle becomes an extension of your will when you have mastered how to ride it.}

It offers a unifying approach based on two fundamental geometric algorithms: - the ellipsoid method for finding a point in a convex set and - the basis reduction method for point lattices. The ellipsoid method was used by Khachiyan to show the polynomial time solvability of linear programming. The basis reduction method yields a polynomial time procedure for certain diophantine approximation problems. A combination of these techniques makes it possible to show the polynomial time solvability of many questions concerning poyhedra - for instance, of linear programming problems having possibly exponentially many inequalities. Utilizing results from polyhedral combinatorics, it provides short proofs of the poynomial time solvability of many combinatiorial optimization problems. For a number of these problems, the geometric algorithms discussed in this book are the only techniques known to derive polynomial time solvability. This book is a continuation and extension of previous research of the authors for which they received the Fulkerson Prize, awarded by the Mathematical Programming Society and the American Mathematical Society.}

Here at last is a completely impartial guide that gives project managers both expert objective analysis of Agile software development methods and much-needed tools for evaluating the suitability of Agile methods for their organization. The book reviews the Agile Manifesto and the 12 Agile Principles, and discusses in detail each practice of the six most widely recognized Agile methods. Software developers get clear and unbiased insight into adoption implications, the benefits that may accrue, and the potential pitfalls they face. At its core, this unique assessment resource helps developers systematically address key Agile adoption issues involving organizational culture, customers, staff, tools and processes, and project considerations. A comprehensive start-to-finish worksheet makes it easy for professionals to document observations, draw justifiable conclusions, and market their recommendations to the company. The guide also features expert guidelines for customizing an Agile method, training staff, testing the new method, and evaluating its performance - should readers go the Agile route. Practical ready-to-use tools, including equations and templates in Excel format, are provided in a handy workbook which can be accessed through the author's website.}

  note = {*The Art of Agile Development* contains practical guidance for anyone considering or applying agile development for building valuable software. Plenty of books describe what agile development is or why it helps software projects succeed, but very few combine information for developers, managers, testers, and customers into a single package that they can apply directly. This book provides no-nonsense advice on agile planning, development, delivery, and management taken from the authors' many years of experience with Extreme Programming (XP). You get a gestalt view of the agile development process, including comprehensive guidance for non-technical readers and hands-on technical practices for developers and testers. The Art of Agile Development gives you clear answers to questions such as: * How can we adopt agile development? * Do we really need to pair program? * What metrics should we report? * What if I can't get my customer to participate? * How much documentation should we write? * When do we design and architect? * As a non-developer, how should I work with my agile team? * Where is my product roadmap? * How does QA fit in? The book teaches you how to adopt XP practices, describes each practice in detail, then discusses principles that will allow you to modify XP and create your own agile method. In particular, this book tackles the difficult aspects of agile development: the need for cooperation and trust among team members. Whether you're currently part of an agile team, working with an agile team, or interested in agile development, this book provides the practical tips you need to start practicing agile development. As your experience grows, the book will grow with you, providing exercises and information that will teach you first to understand the rules of agile development, break them, and ultimately abandon rules altogether as you master the art of agile development. "Jim Shore and Shane Warden expertly explain the practices and benefits of Extreme Programming. They offer advice from their real-world experiences in leading teams. They answer questions about the practices and show contraindications - ways that a practice may be mis-applied. They offer alternatives you can try if there are impediments to applying a practice, such as the lack of an on-site customer. –Ken Pugh, Author of Jolt Award Winner, *Prefactoring* "I will leave a copy of this book with every team I visit." –Brian Marick, Exampler Consulting \#\#\# About the Author James Shore, signatory number ten to the Agile Manifesto, has been coaching agile teams large and small before they were called agile. He brings both breadth and depth to his discussion of agile development. In 2005, the Agile Alliance recognized James with their most significant award, the Gordon Pask Award for Contributions to Agile Practice. James is an internationally recognized speaker who consults for companies interested in agile development. He writes about agile development on his top-ranked blog, jamesshore.com. Shane Warden manages Onyx Neon Press, an independent publisher. His areas of expertise include agile software development, language design, and virtual machines for dynamic languages. He is also a published novelist. His books include The Art of Agile Development and Masterminds of Programming.}

Analytic techniques, simulation techniques, and hybrids are discussed. The applicability of different analytic approaches to different types of DSP design is covered, -The development of techniques to optimise the precision requirements of a DSP algorithm, aiming for efficient implementation in a custom parallel processor. The idea is to trade-off numerical accuracy for area or power-consumption advantages. Again, both analytic and simulation techniques for estimating numerical accuracy are described and contrasted. Optimum and heuristic approaches to precision optimisation are discussed, -A discussion of the importance of the scheduling, allocation, and binding problems, and development of techniques to automate these processes with reference to a precision-optimized algorithm, -Future perspectives for synthesis and optimization of DSP algorithms.}

  note = {(Pearson Education) Working solutions to programming challenges faced by Java developers on a daily basis, revealing what to do to produce clear, robust and efficient code. Include rules in short essay form, and the author's 'war stories,' giving advice and insights into nuances of the language. Softcover. \#\#\# Amazon.com Review Written for the working Java developer, Joshua Bloch's *Effective Java Programming Language Guide* provides a truly useful set of over 50 best practices and tips for writing better Java code. With plenty of advice from an indisputable expert in the field, this title is sure to be an indispensable resource for anyone who wants to get more out of their code. As a veteran developer at Sun, the author shares his considerable insight into the design choices made over the years in Sun's own Java libraries (which the author acknowledges haven't always been perfect). Based on his experience working with Sun's best minds, the author provides a compilation of 57 tips for better Java code organized by category. Many of these ideas will let you write more robust classes that better cooperate with built-in Java APIs. Many of the tips make use of software patterns and demonstrate an up-to-the-minute sense of what works best in today's design. Each tip is clearly introduced and explained with code snippets used to demonstrate each programming principle. Early sections on creating and destroying objects show you ways to make better use of resources, including how to avoid duplicate objects. Next comes an absolutely indispensable guide to implementing "required" methods for custom classes. This material will help you write new classes that cooperate with old ones (with advice on implementing essential requirements like the *equals()* and *hashCode()* methods). The author has a lot to say about class design, whether using inheritance or composition. Tips on designing methods show you how to create understandable, maintainable, and robust classes that can be easily reused by others on your team. Sections on mapping C code (like structures, unions, and enumerated types) onto Java will help C programmers bring their existing skills to Sun's new language. Later sections delve into some general programming tips, like using exceptions effectively. The book closes with advice on using threads and synchronization techniques, plus some worthwhile advice on object serialization. Whatever your level of Java knowledge, this title can make you a more effective programmer. Wisely written, yet never pompous or doctrinaire, the author has succeeded in packaging some really valuable nuggets of advice into a concise and very accessible guidebook that arguably deserves a place on most any developer's bookshelf. *–Richard Dragan* **Topics covered:** * Best practices and tips for Java * Creating and destroying objects (static factory methods, singletons, avoiding duplicate objects and finalizers) * Required methods for custom classes (overriding *equals()*, *hashCode()*, *toString()*, *clone()*, and *compareTo()* properly) * Hints for class and interface design (minimizing class and member accessibility, immutability, composition versus inheritance, interfaces versus abstract classes, preventing subclassing, static versus nonstatic classes) * C constructs in Java (structures, unions, enumerated types, and function pointers in Java) * Tips for designing methods (parameter validation, defensive copies, method signatures, method overloading, zero-length arrays, hints for Javadoc comments) * General programming advice (local variable scope, using Java API libraries, avoiding *float* and *double* for exact comparisons, when to avoid strings, string concatenation, interfaces and reflection, avoid native methods, optimizing hints, naming conventions) * Programming with exceptions (checked versus run-time exceptions, standard exceptions, documenting exceptions, failure-capture information, failure atomicity) * Threading and multitasking (synchronization and scheduling hints, thread safety, avoiding thread groups) * Serialization (when to implement *Serializable*, the *readObject()*, and *readResolve()* methods) \#\#\# From the Back Cover "An excellent book, crammed with good advice on using the JavaTM programming language and object-oriented programming in general." –Gilad Bracha, Computational Theologist, Sun Microsystems, Inc., and co-author of *The JavaTM Language Specification, Second Edition* "I sure wish I had this book ten years ago. Some might think that I don't need any Java books, but I need this one." –James Gosling, Fellow and Vice President, Sun Microsystems, Inc., and inventor of the JavaTM programming language Are you looking for a concise book packed with insight and wisdom not found elsewhere? Need to really understand the Java programming language; that is, really understand it? Do you want to write code that is clear, correct, robust, and reusable? Look no further! The book you are holding will provide you with this and many other benefits you may not even know you were looking for. Become a more effective programmer. Featuring fifty-seven valuable rules of thumb, ***Effective JavaTM Programming Language Guide*** contains working solutions to the programming challenges most developers encounter every day. Offering comprehensive descriptions of techniques used by the experts who developed the Java platform, the book reveals what to do–and what not to do–in order to produce clear, robust, and efficient code. Each rule appears in the form of a short, stand-alone essay offering insight, code examples, and "war stories" from this uniquely qualified author. The essays include specific advice and insights into the subtleties of the language and are illustrated with exceptional code examples. Throughout the book, common language idioms and design patterns are examined and insightful and enlightening tips and techniques are provided. Coverage includes: * Customary and effective language usage that is saturated with expert advice in a concise, readable, and easy-to-access format. * Patterns, antipatterns, and idioms to help you get the most out of the Java platform. * Commonly misunderstood subtleties of the language and its libraries: how to avoid the traps and pitfalls. * Focus on the language and its most fundamental libraries: java.lang, java.util, and, to a lesser extent, java.io. * Detailed coverage of serialization, including practical advice that is not available elsewhere. Appealing to a broad spectrum of the programming community, ***Effective JavaTM Programming Language Guide*** presents the most practical, authoritative guidelines available for writing efficient, well-designed programs for the Java platform. 0201310058B07092001}

  note = {Whatever your programming language, whatever your platform, you probably tap into linker and loader functions all the time. But do you know how to use them to their greatest possible advantage? Only now, with the publication of **Linkers \& Loaders**, is there an authoritative book devoted entirely to these deep-seated compile-time and run-time processes. The book begins with a detailed and comparative account of linking and loading that illustrates the differences among various compilers and operating systems. On top of this foundation, the author presents clear practical advice to help you create faster, cleaner code. You'll learn to avoid the pitfalls associated with Windows DLLs, take advantage of the space-saving, performance-improving techniques supported by many modern linkers, make the best use of the UNIX ELF library scheme, and much more. If you're serious about programming, you'll devour this unique guide to one of the field's least understood topics. **Linkers \& Loaders** is also an ideal supplementary text for compiler and operating systems courses. *Includes a linker construction project written in Perl, with project files available for download. *Covers dynamic linking in Windows, UNIX, Linux, BeOS, and other operating systems. *Explains the Java linking model and how it figures in network applets and extensible Java code. *Helps you write more elegant and effective code, and build applications that compile, load, and run more efficiently. \#\#\# Amazon.com Review Written for any programmer who works with compiled code, *Linkers and Loaders* surveys today's hardware platforms with a tour of how code is linked and executed on IBM mainframes, Unix, and Windows. This handy title fills a valuable niche for anyone who wants to understand how programs are built and run on today's computing systems. It's the cross-platform perspective that distinguishes this book. The author's wide-ranging perspective on IBM 370 mainframes, RISC platforms like the SUN SPARC and, of course, Microsoft Windows makes this book a commendable reference on the internals of linkers and program execution in each environment. There's also a digestible guide to the computer architecture (including registers, instruction formats, and memory addressing) for each platform. (Unix programmers will be pleased that the book has more information on non-Windows platforms than on Windows itself.) For C++ programmers, this text gives you a glimpse into the internals of such language features as macros, templates, and name mangling, and how linkers deal with them at build time. The book closes with useful material on static libraries and dynamic linking, plus a short tour of Java and its class loader (which can resolve classes on the fly as they are downloaded over the Internet). Short exercises are provided for each chapter, making this a useful resource for both classroom and self-study on what is an often overlooked topic. *–Richard Dragan* **Topics covered**: History of linkers and loaders, application binary interfaces (ABIs), computer architecture basics, big- and little-endian memory addresses, register and instruction formats for IBM 370, SPARC and Intel x86, paging and virtual memory, position independent code (PIC), Intel x86 segmentation, embedded architectures, object files for DOS COM and EXE files, Unix a.out, Unix ELF, IBM 360 object format, Microsoft Portable Executable (PE) format, Intel Object Module Format (OMF), storage allocation, linking details for C++, symbol management, name mangling, weak and strong references, debugging information, library formats, COFF and ELF formats, relocation, loading and overlays, bootstrap loading, shared libraries, dynamic linking for Unix ELF and Microsoft Windows DLLs, advanced linking techniques for C++, and linking in Java. \#\#\# Review "I enjoyed reading this useful overview of the techniques and challenges of implementing linkers and loaders. While most of the examples are focused on three computer architectures that are widely used today, there are also many side comments about interesting and quirky computer architectures of the past. I can tell from these war stories that the author really has been there himself and survived to tell the tale."-Guy Steele}

  note = {Filled with real-world advice for managing software projects, Murray Cantor's Object-Oriented Project Management with UML shows you how to tackle any project using UML and the latest thinking on project management. There's little doubt that this even-handed, commonsensical guide can benefit anyone who manages or designs object-oriented software for a living. The best thing about this book has to be its honest, real-world mix of software engineering theory and real-world practice for managing object-oriented software development. The author refuses to be doctrinaire and continually offers valuable nuggets of practical advice. Regarding the pitfalls of one software development process, he writes, "I am sure someone has succeeded, but I have never seen it done." Later, he advises managers to "never show panic." The book doesn't skimp on specifics with a sample case study on a jet fighter trainer simulation system that has a budget of over {\textdollar}22 million. The book also provides real numbers for project estimation, bug tracking, and resource allocation. You'll even find numbers for measuring productivity, including KLOCs. Numerous sample documents (including sample meeting agendas) round out the tour here. The book offers plenty of good advice for working with upper management, customers, and development teams throughout the software development process. While there's certainly no substitute for actual project management experience, Object-Oriented Project Management with UML may be the next best thing. The author's tour of how to manage object-oriented software development offers dozens of savvy tips and a very thorough guide to using some of the best available techniques for software management. This book is perfect for practically minded IS managers or project leaders who want to see how their software development process can be improved using UML with rigorous management techniques. –Richard Dragan Topics covered: object-oriented project management overview; obstacles; UML basics; use cases; class diagrams; lifecycle models: waterfall, spiral, RAD; time box model and controlled iteration; Software Development Plans (SDPs); budgeting; project estimation; management tips for inception, elaboration, construction, and transition phases; software metrics: KLOCs and COCOMO; measuring productivity; and sample meeting agendas.}

Now in its second edition, author Dave Thomas has expanded the famous Pickaxe book with over 200 pages of new content, covering all the improved language features of Ruby 1.8 and standard library modules. The Pickaxe contains four major sections: * An acclaimed tutorial on using Ruby. * The definitive reference to the language. * Complete documentation on all built-in classes, modules, and methods * Complete descriptions of all 98 standard libraries. If you enjoyed the First Edition, you'll appreciate the expanded content, including enhanced coverage of installation, packaging, documenting Ruby source code, threading and synchronization, and enhancing Ruby's capabilities using C-language extensions. Programming for the World Wide Web is easy in Ruby, with new chapters on XML/RPC, SOAP, distributed Ruby, templating systems, and other web services. There's even a new chapter on unit testing. This is the definitive reference manual for Ruby, including a description of all the standard library modules, a complete reference to all built-in classes and modules (including more than 250 significant changes since the First Edition). Coverage of other features has grown tremendously, including details on how to harness the sophisticated capabilities of irb, so you can dynamically examine and experiment with your running code. "Ruby is a wonderfully powerful and useful language, and whenever I'm working with it this book is at my side" –Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist, ThoughtWorks \#\#\# About the Author Dave Thomas, as one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, understands agility.

  note = {* The perfect reference for programmers, administrators, or Web designers who are new to database development and are uncertain as to how to design and structure a database efficiently * Shows how to design and implement robust, scalable databases on any of the major relational database management systems, including Access, SQL Server, IBM DB2, MySQL, and Oracle * Covers all the key database design steps including modeling, normalization, SQL, denormalization, object-modeling, data warehousing, and performance * Provides plenty of real-world examples and a complete beginning-to-end case study of creating a database that includes the analysis and planning, tables and data structures, business rules, and hardware requirements \#\#\# From the Back Cover Database design involves how to best structure the tables and queries that are used with databases in order to provide optimum performance, storage, manageability, and flexibility. With relational databases, you can use those tables to organize your data and retrieve information from your database. This book provides you with an easy-to-understand explanation of designing and building relational database models to do just that. The numerous step-by-step examples and a helpful case study simplify a potentially complex subject and present it to you in an organized, understandable manner. You'll find out why relational database models became necessary in the first place, and how the relational database model was devised. Ultimately, you'll discover how to make much better use of your database by applying what you've learned about building the database model. What you will learn from this book * Basic concepts of relational database modeling * The components of a relational database model * Making normalization easier to use * Advanced relational database modeling * How to improve relational database model performance * Describing tables during using analysis (WHAT needs to be solved) * Refining tables and relationships using design (HOW to provide solutions) * How to read and write data with SQL * Create relational database models by applying business rules Who this book is for This book is for new database developers. No prior database or programming experience is required. Wrox Beginning guides are crafted to make learning programming languages and technologies easier than you think, providing a structured, tutorial format that will guide you through all the techniques involved. \#\#\# About the Author **Gavin Powell** has a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, with numerous professional accreditations and skills (including Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Windows 2000, ERWin, and Paintshop, as well as Microsoft Access, Ingres, and Oracle relational databases, plus a multitude of application development languages).

The material concentrates on fundamental theories as well as techniques and algorithms. The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, and, more recently, the emergence of cloud computing and streaming data applications, has forced a renewal of interest in distributed and parallel data management, while, at the same time, requiring a rethinking of some of the traditional techniques. This book covers the breadth and depth of this re-emerging field. The coverage consists of two parts. The first part discusses the fundamental principles of distributed data management and includes distribution design, data integration, distributed query processing and optimization, distributed transaction management, and replication. The second part focuses on more advanced topics and includes discussion of parallel database systems, distributed object management, peer-to-peer data management, web data management, data stream systems, and cloud computing. New in this Edition: New chapters, covering database replication, database integration, multidatabase query processing, peer-to-peer data management, and web data management. Coverage of emerging topics such as data streams and cloud computing Extensive revisions and updates based on years of class testing and feedback Ancillary teaching materials are available.}

I’m sure you’ll find the read rewarding.” —From the Foreword by Scott Meyers D is a programming language built to help programmers address the challenges of modern software development. It does so by fostering modules interconnected through precise interfaces, a federation of tightly integrated programming paradigms, language-enforced thread isolation, modular type safety, an efficient memory model, and more. ***The D Programming Language ***is an authoritative and comprehensive introduction to D. Reflecting the author’s signature style, the writing is casual and conversational, but never at the expense of focus and pre­cision. It covers all aspects of the language (such as expressions, statements, types, functions, contracts, and modules), but it is much more than an enumeration of features. Inside the book you will find * In-depth explanations, with idiomatic examples, for all language features * How feature groups support major programming paradigms * Rationale and best-use advice for each major feature * Discussion of cross-cutting issues, such as error handling, contract programming, and concurrency * Tables, figures, and “cheat sheets” that serve as a handy quick reference for day-to-day problem solving with D Written for the working programmer, ***The D Programming Language ***not only introduces the D language—it presents a compendium of good practices and idioms to help both your coding with D and your coding in general. \#\#\# About the Author **Andrei Alexandrescu, Ph.D., **is the author of the award-winning books *Modern C++ Design *(Addison-Wesley, 2001) and, with Herb Sutter, *C++ Coding Standards *(Addison-Wesley, 2005). Through his work, Andrei has garnered a solid reputation as a leading innovator in programming languages and methods. Since 2006, he has collaborated closely with Walter Bright—the original designer and implementer of D—on designing and implementing the language and its standard library.}

  note = {Parallel-Algorithms for Regular Architectures is the first book to concentrate exclusively on algorithms and paradigms for programming parallel computers such as the hypercube, mesh, pyramid, and mesh-of-trees. Algorithms are given to solve fundamental tasks such as sorting and matrix operations, as well as problems in the field of image processing, graph theory, and computational geometry. The first chapter defines the computer models, problems to be solved, and notation that will be used throughout the book. It also describes fundamental abstract data movement operations that serve as the foundation to many of the algorithms presented in the book. The remaining chapters describe efficient implementations of these operations for specific models of computation and present algorithms (with asymptotic analyses) that are often based on these operations.The algorithms presented are the most efficient known, including a number of new algorithms for the hypercube and mesh-of-trees that are better than those that have previously appeared in the literature. The chapters may be read independently, allowing anyone interested in a specific model to read the introduction and then move directly to the chapter(s) devoted to the particular model of interest.Russ Miller is Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, State University of New York at Buffalo.

  date = {1998-01},
  note = {Principles of Transaction Processing is a clear, concise guide for anyone involved in developing applications, evaluating products, designing systems, or engineering products. This book provides an understanding of the internals of transaction processing systems, describing how they work and how best to use them. It includes the architecture of Web Application Servers, transactional communications paradigms, and mechanisms for recovering from transaction and system failures. The use of transaction processing systems has changed in the years since publication of the first edition. Electronic commerce has become a major focus for business data processing investments, from banking and stock purchase on the web, to eBay auctions, to corporate database management. New standards, new technology and products, and new languages allow web services and SOA to become the leading style of design for enterprise applications. And with the help of this book and its rich examples, you will be able to produce the state-of-the-art applications discussed within. For more information check out Eric Newcomer's blog: http://ericnewcomer.wordpress.com/2009/05/15/what-we-learned-writing-the-second-edition-of-the-tp-book/ * Complete revision of the classic "non mathematical" transaction processing reference for systems professionals. * Updated to focus on the needs of transaction processing via the Internet– the main focus of business data processing investments, via web application servers, SOA, and important new TP standards. * Retains the practical, non-mathematical, but thorough conceptual basis of the first edition. \#\#\# Amazon.com Review What do reserving a seat on an airplane, buying a movie ticket over the Internet, and launching a missile all have in common? *Principles of Transaction Processing for the Systems Professional* explains that these and many other computerized tasks require the use of transaction processing (TP). Authors Philip Bernstein and Eric Newcomer demonstrate that this previously specialized area of systems design is becoming more important with the growth of Internet commerce. This theoretically astute and practical-minded book begins with a description of the principles of successful transaction management. (The so-called "ACID" test requires that transactions be atomistic, consistent, isolated, and durable.) The authors illustrate the principles with real-world examples of transactions in everyday life, such as ATM systems and the stock market. Bernstein and Newcomer then outline how transaction processing monitors work and discuss some of the details, such as interface definition languages, which let disparate computers communicate, and remote procedure calls. The text also explores some real-world TP monitor products, from IBM's CICS to Tuxedo to Microsoft Transaction Server. While transaction processing has been a part of mainframe system design for decades, it has recently become relevant for commerce and everyday database access on the Web. The authors look at today's Web servers–Microsoft Internet Information Server and Netscape's FastTrack Server–and show how they manage transactions. Additional chapters move back into the theoretical, with descriptions of database transactions and strategies for replicating data. The text finishes up with some predictions on where this vital and established technology is headed. This book is a must for any developer who is designing a Web site that connects users to data in a distributed environment. It's also a definitive guide to an intriguing area of computing. \#\#\# Review "The best introduction to transaction processing systems I have ever read." —K.Torp, ACM Computing Reviews, November 1997}

This text is the first to combine the study of these two subjects, their basics and their use, along with symbolic AI methods to build comprehensive artificial intelligence systems. In a clear and accessible style, Kasabov describes rule- based and connectionist techniques and then their combinations, with fuzzy logic included, showing the application of the different techniques to a set of simple prototype problems, which makes comparisons possible. A particularly strong feature of the text is that it is filled with applications in engineering, business, and finance. AI problems that cover most of the application-oriented research in the field (pattern recognition, speech and image processing, classification, planning, optimization, prediction, control, decision making, and game simulations) are discussed and illustrated with concrete examples. Intended both as a text for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as a reference for researchers in the field of knowledge engineering, *Foundations of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Knowledge Engineering* has chapters structured for various levels of teaching and includes original work by the author along with the classic material. Data sets for the examples in the book as well as an integrated software environment that can be used to solve the problems and do the exercises at the end of each chapter are available free through anonymous ftp. \#\#\# Amazon.com Review Here we have a comprehensive, problem-oriented, engineering perspective on the uses of neural nets, fuzzy systems, and hybrids that emphasizes practical solutions to everyday artificial intelligence (AI) problems over abstract theoretical noodling. Intended for upper-division students and postgraduates who need a solid grounding in knowledge engineering, *Foundations of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Knowledge Engineering* is still useful as a reference for professionals and even as a text for advanced students in the lower levels. Taking problems as diverse as soil classification and speech recognition, Kasabov shows the relative merits and failings of the different architectures and hybrids through examples and problems to solve. Organized as a textbook, the first two chapters cover the field as a whole and present traditional AI approaches to knowledge engineering. Subsequent chapters examine the particulars of fuzzy systems, neural networks, hybrids, and new models. *Foundations* assumes a good understanding of undergraduate-level mathematics; those who wish to fully explore the problems on their own can obtain the requisite software for free through anonymous FTP. *–Rob Lightner* \#\#\# Review "Covering the latest issues and achievements, this well documented, precisely presented text is timely and suitable for graduate and upper undergraduate students in knowledge engineering, intelligent systems, AI, neural networks, fuzzy systems, and related areas. The author's goal is to explain the principles of neural networks and fuzzy systems and to demonstrate how they can be applied to building knowledge-based systems for problem solving. Especially useful are the comparisons between different techniques (AI rule-based methods, fuzzy methods, connectionist methods, hybrid systems) used to solve the same or similar problems." —**Anca Ralescu**, Associate Professor of Computer Science, University of Cincinnati}

  volume = {1},

  date = {2000-03},
  note = {In the first edition of *Thinking in C++*, Bruce Eckel synthesized years of C++ teaching and programming experience into a beautifully structured course in making the most of the language. It became an instant classic, winning the 1995 *Software Development Jolt Cola* Award for best book of the year. Now, Eckel has thoroughly rewritten *Thinking in C++* to reflect the final ANSI/ISO C++ standard. Every page has been revisited and rethought, with many new examples and exercises – all designed to help you understand C++ "down to the bare metal," so you can solve virtually any problem. Eckel starts with a detailed look at objects, showing how C++ programs can be constructed from off-the-shelf object libraries. This edition includes a new, chapter-length overview of the C features that are used in C++ – plus a new CD-ROM containing an outstanding C seminar that covers all the foundations developers need before they can truly take advantage of C++. Eckel then walks through initialization and cleanup; function overloading and default arguments; constants; inline functions; name control; references and the copy constructor; operator overloading; and more. There are chapters on dynamic object creation; inheritance and composition; polymorphism and virtual functions, and templates. (Bonus coverage of string, templates, and the Standard Template Library, can be found at Eckel's web site.) Every chapter contains many modular, to-the-point examples, plus exercises based on Eckel's extensive experience teaching C++ seminars. Put simply, Eckel has made an outstanding book on C++ even better. \#\#\# Amazon.com Review Fully revised and beefed up with plenty of new material on today's Standard C++, the new edition of Bruce Eckel's *Thinking in C++: Volume I* is an excellent tutorial to mastering this rich (and sometimes daunting) programming language, filled with expert advice and written in a patient, knowledgeable style. The effective presentation, along with dozens of helpful code examples, make this book a standout. The text first sets the stage for using C++ with a tour of what object-oriented programming is all about, as well as the software design life cycle. The author then delves into every aspect of C++, from basic keywords and programming principles to more advanced topics, like function and operator overloading, virtual inheritance, exception handling, namespaces, and templates. C++ is a complex language, and the author covers a lot of ground using today's Standard C++, but without getting bogged down in excessive detail. The emphasis here is on practical programming, so there's basic advice on using header files, preprocessor directives, and namespaces to organize code effectively. Each chapter ends with exercises (usually about two dozen), and the entire text of the book is available on the accompanying CD-ROM. (So is the second volume, which tours Standard C++ classes and other advanced topics.) Whether you have read the first edition of this book or not, there is much to mine from *Thinking in C++*. This new version continues to set a high standard as an approachable and thorough tutorial. *–Richard Dragan* **Topics covered**: Introduction to objects, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, exception handling, analysis and design fundamentals, advantages of C++, transitioning from C, compiling and building programs, writing C++ functions, flow control, C++ operators, data types, casting, debugging tips, pointers to functions, designing reusable C++ classes, conditional compilation and header files, access specifiers, constructors and destructors, function overloading and default arguments, using *const* and *static* effectively, inlining, namespaces, references, copy constructors, operator overloading, using *new* and *delete* for dynamic objects, virtual functions, abstract classes, introduction to templates, and iterators. \#\#\# Review "This book is a tremendous achievement. You owe it to yourself to have a copy on your shelf. The chapter on iostreams is the most comprehensive and understandable treatment of that subject I've seen to date." — *Al Stevens Contributing Editor, Doctor Dobbs Journal* "Eckel's book is the only one to so clearly explain how to rethink program construction for object orientation. That the book is also an excellent tutorial on the ins and outs of C++ is an added bonus." — *Andrew Binstock, Editor, Unix Review* "Bruce continues to amaze me with his insight into C++, and *Thinking in C++* is his best collection of ideas yet.

The entire effort is woven in a fabric that includes Eckel's own philosophy of object and program design. A must for every C++ developer's bookshelf, *Thinking in C++* is the one C++ book you must have if you're doing serious development with C++." — *Richard Male Shaw Contributing Editor, PC Magazine*}

In this book, you'll learn how to become an entrepreneur, driving your career in the direction of your choosing. You'll learn how to build your software development career step by step, following the same path that you would follow if you were building, marketing, and selling a product. After all, your skills themselves **are** a product. The choices you make about which technologies to focus on and which business domains to master have at least as much impact on your success as your technical knowledge itself–don't let those choices be accidental. We'll walk through all aspects of the decision-making process, so you can ensure that you're investing your time and energy in the right areas. You'll develop a structured plan for keeping your mind engaged and your skills fresh. You'll learn how to assess your skills in terms of where they fit on the value chain, driving you away from commodity skills and toward those that are in high demand. Through a mix of high-level, thought-provoking essays and tactical "Act on It" sections, you will come away with concrete plans you can put into action immediately. You'll also get a chance to read the perspectives of several highly successful members of our industry from a variety of career paths. As with any product or service, if nobody knows what you're selling, nobody will buy. We'll walk through the often-neglected world of marketing, and you'll create a plan to market yourself both inside your company and to the industry in general. Above all, you'll see how **you** can set the direction of your career, leading to a more fulfilling and remarkable professional life. \#\#\# About the Author Chad Fowler is an internationally known software developer, trainer, manager, speaker, and musician.

  note = {Thinking in Java, Second Edition is the much-anticipated revision of Bruce Eckel's best-selling Java introduction: the book that won the 1999 Software Development Magazine Productivity Award! Eckel is as brash, opinionated, knowledgeable, and fascinating as ever – and he's updated this new edition to fully reflect the power of Java 2. As always, Eckel doesn't just show you what to do, but why. He introduces all the basics of objects as Java uses them; then walks carefully through the fundamentals of Java programming, including program flow, initialization and cleanup, implementation hiding, reusing classes and polymorphism. Using to-the-point examples, he introduces exception handling, Java I/O, run-time type identification, and passing and returning objects. The new edition adds exceptional coverage of server-side Java, including servlets and JavaServer Pages; Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) database integration, transactions, and security; and much more. The AWT chapter has been replaced with a thorough introduction to the Swing GUI libraries, and there are new sections on Jini and JavaSpaces. All code examples are on the accompanying CD-ROM, plus electronic copies of the book in several formats, and the complete Thinking in C multimedia course, introducing key concepts all beginning programmers must master before learning Java. \#\#\# Amazon.com Review Perfect for migrating to Java from a fellow object-oriented language (such as C++), the second edition of *Thinking in Java* continues the earlier version's thoughtful approach to learning Java inside and out, while also bringing it up to speed with some of the latest in Java 2 features. This massive tutorial covers many of the nooks and crannies of the language, which is of great value in the programming world. The most prominent feature of the book is its diligent and extremely thorough treatment of the Java language, with special attention to object design. (For instance, 10 pages of sample code show *all* of the available operators.) Some of the best thinking about objects is in this book, including when to use composition over inheritance. The esoteric details of Java in regard to defining classes are thoroughly laid out. (The material on interfaces, inner classes, and designing for reuse will please any expert.) Each section also has sample exercises that let you try out and expand your Java knowledge. Besides getting the reader to "think in objects," *Thinking in Java* also covers other APIs in Java 2. Excellent sections include an in-depth tour of Java's collection and stream classes, and enterprise-level APIs like servlets, JSPs, EJBs, and RMI. Weighing in at over 1,000 pages, any reader who is serious about learning Java inside and out will want to take a look at this superior resource on some of the latest and most advanced thinking in object design. *–Richard Dragan* **Topics covered:** * Object-design basics * Inheritance and polymorphism * Object lifetimes * Exception handling * Multithreading and persistence * Java on the Internet * Analysis and design basics * Java basics: keywords and flow control * Initializing objects * Garbage collection * Java packages * Designing for reuse: composition vs. inheritance * The *final* keyword * Interfaces and inner classes * Arrays and container classes * Java I/O classes * Run-time type identification * UI design basics with Swing * Deploying to JAR files * Network programming with sockets * JDBC database programming * Introduction to servlets * JavaServer Pages (JSPs) * RMI * CORBA * Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) and Jini * Cloning objects * The Java Native Interface (JNI) * Java programming guidelines \#\#\# Review "This book is a tremendous achievement.

  note = {A thrilling historical account of the worst cholera outbreak in Victorian London-and a brilliant exploration of how Dr. John Snow's solution revolutionized the way we think about disease, cities, science, and the modern world. From the dynamic thinker routinely compared to Malcolm Gladwell, E. O. Wilson, and James Gleick, The Ghost Map is a riveting page-turner with a real-life historical hero that brilliantly illuminates the intertwined histories of the spread of viruses, rise of cities, and the nature of scientific inquiry. These are topics that have long obsessed Steven Johnson, and The Ghost Map is a true triumph of the kind of multidisciplinary thinking for which he's become famous-a book that, like the work of Jared Diamond, presents both vivid history and a powerful and provocative explanation of what it means for the world we live in. The Ghost Map takes place in the summer of 1854. A devastating cholera outbreak seizes London just as it is emerging as a modern city: more than 2 million people packed into a ten-mile circumference, a hub of travel and commerce, teeming with people from all over the world, continually pushing the limits of infrastructure that's outdated as soon as it's updated. Dr. John Snow-whose ideas about contagion had been dismissed by the scientific community-is spurred to intense action when the people in his neighborhood begin dying. With enthralling suspense, Johnson chronicles Snow's day-by-day efforts, as he risks his own life to prove how the epidemic is being spread. When he creates the map that traces the pattern of outbreak back to its source, Dr. Snow didn't just solve the most pressing medical riddle of his time. He ultimately established a precedent for the way modern city-dwellers, city planners, physicians, and public officials think about the spread of disease and the development of the modern urban environment. The Ghost Map is an endlessly compelling and utterly gripping account of that London summer of 1854, from the microbial level to the macrourban-theory level-including, most important, the human level.}

  note = {Embedded systems are becoming one of the major driving forces in computer science. Furthermore, it is the impact of embedded information technology that dictates the pace in most engineering domains. Nearly all technical products above a certain level of complexity are not only controlled but increasingly even dominated by their embedded computer systems. Traditionally, such embedded control systems have been implemented in a monolithic, centralized way. Recently, distributed solutions are gaining increasing importance. In this approach, the control task is carried out by a number of controllers distributed over the entire system and connected by some interconnect network, like fieldbuses. Such a distributed embedded system may consist of a few controllers up to several hundred, as in today's top-range automobiles. Distribution and parallelism in embedded systems design increase the engineering challenges and require new development methods and tools. This book is the result of the International Workshop on Distributed and Parallel Embedded Systems (DIPES'98), organized by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Working Groups 10.3 (Concurrent Systems) and 10.5 (Design and Engineering of Electronic Systems). The workshop took place in October 1998 in Schloss Eringerfeld, near Paderborn, Germany, and the resulting book reflects the most recent points of view of experts from Brazil, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and the USA. The book is organized in six chapters: Formalisms for Embedded System Design': IP-based system design and various approaches to multi-language formalisms. Synthesis from Synchronous/Asynchronous Specification': Synthesis techniques based on Message Sequence Charts (MSC), StateCharts, and Predicate/Transition Nets. Partitioning and Load-Balancing': Application in simulation models and target systems. Design Environments' for distributed embedded systems and their impact on the industrial state of the art. Object Oriented Approaches': Impact of OO-techniques on distributed embedded systems. /LIST This volume will be essential reading for computer science researchers and application developers.}

As every logician will know, this is a work of extraordinary scholarship, essential for any graduate logician who needs to know where the current boundaries of research are situated. Each chapter ends with a valuable historical survey and there is an extensive bibliography. This will continue to be the bible for set theorists in the new century." (Gerry Leversha, The Mathematical Gazette, March, 2005) "The book does masterly what it is supposed to do. ... every mathematician who wishes to refresh his knowledge of set theory will read it with pleasure. ... They will also find historical notes, and precise references ... . A very comprehensive bibliography, and detailed indexes complete the work. This book fills a serious gap in the literature and there is no doubt that it will become a standard reference ... . One can strongly recommend its acquisition for any mathematical library." (Jean-Roger Roisin, Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society, Vol. 11 (3), 2004) "One of the classical textbooks and reference books in set theory is Jech’s Set Theory. ... The present ‘Third Millennium’ edition ... is a whole new book. In three parts the author offers us what in his view every young set theorist should learn and master. ... This well-written book promises to influence the next generation of set theorists, much as its predecessor has done over the last quarter of a century." (Eva Coplakova, Mathematical Reviews, 2004 g) "Jech’s book, ‘Set Theory’ has been a standard reference for over 25 years. This ‘Third Millennium Edition’, not only includes all the materials in the first two editions, but also covers recent developments of set theory during the last 25 years. We believe that this new version will become a standard reference on set theory for the next few years." (Guohua Wu, New Zealand Mathematical Society Newsletter, April, 2004) "Jech’s classic monograph has been a standard reference for a generation of set theorists. Though ... labeled ‘The Third Millennium Edition’, the present work is in fact a new book. ... Even sections presenting older results have been rewritten and modernized. Exercises have been moved to the end of each section. The bibliography, the section on notation, and the index have been considerably expanded as well. This new edition will certainly become a standard reference on set theory for years to come." (Jörg D. Brendle, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1007, 2003) "Thomas Jech’s Set Theory contains the most comprehensive treatment of the subject in any one volume. The present third edition is a revised and expanded version ... . The third edition has three parts. The first, Jech says, every student of set theory should learn, the second every set theorist should master and the third consists of various results reflecting ‘the state of the art of set theory at the turn of the new millennium’. This last part especially contains a lot of new material." (Martin Bunder, The Australian Mathematical Society Gazette, Vol. 30 (2), 2003) \#\#\# From the Back Cover Set Theory has experienced a rapid development in recent years, with major advances in forcing, inner models, large cardinals and descriptive set theory. The present book covers each of these areas, giving the reader an understanding of the ideas involved. It can be used for introductory students and is broad and deep enough to bring the reader near the boundaries of current research. Students and researchers in the field will find the book invaluable both as a study material and as a desktop reference.}

  note = {Two important subproblems of computer vision are the detection and recognition of 2D objects in gray-level images. This book discusses the construction and training of models, computational approaches to efficient implementation, and parallel implementations in biologically plausible neural network architectures. The approach is based on statistical modeling and estimation, with an emphasis on simplicity, transparency, and computational efficiency.The book describes a range of deformable template models, from coarse sparse models involving discrete, fast computations to more finely detailed models based on continuum formulations, involving intensive optimization. Each model is defined in terms of a subset of points on a reference grid (the template), a set of admissible instantiations of these points (deformations), and a statistical model for the data given a particular instantiation of the object present in the image. A recurring theme is a coarse to fine approach to the solution of vision problems. The book provides detailed descriptions of the algorithms used as well as the code, and the software and data sets are available on the Web. \#\#\# Review "Modeling the human ability to identify objects in images has proved to be a significant challenge. While computer vision researchers have largely concentrated on the geometric aspects of the problem such as recognition under varying poses, researchers in statistics and machine learning typically have treated the problem as one of classifying feature vectors. In this important book, Yali Amit presents a novel synthesis of these strands of research. His approach to recognition based on learned configurations of sparse features provides a rare combination of efficient algorithms based on a solid statistical foundation. Amit's thorough and well-documented experimentation with examples ranging from medical images to handwritten digits should set a standard for the field. Highly recommended."–Jitendra Malik, Department of Computer Science, University of California at BerkeleyPlease note: Endorser gives permission to excerpt from quote. "The book develops a novel and elegant approach to the important problem of visual object recognition. The efficient and well motivated algorithms have fundamental theoretical as well as practical implications to the study of computer vision. The book will appeal to computer scientists as well as researchers modeling the functions of biological visual systems."–Shimon Ullman, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel \#\#\# About the Author Yali Amit is Professor of Statistics and Computer Science at the University of Chicago.}

  note = {Introduces the core concepts, evaluates how successful they can be, as well as what problems may be encountered Dispels numerous myths surrounding agile development \#\#\# Review From the reviews: "A very comprehensive guide to the most popular current agile methods. The author fully succeeds in bringing together, in a very concise style, not only the essential approaches and methods ... but also the necessary tools for a more effective application of agile methods in the real software development process. ... By its content, the book addresses the software development theorists and practitioners alike. By its style, it is an excellent guide for any kind of student interested in achieving skills for agile software construction." (Tudor Balanescu, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1095 (21), 2006) "Cyberneticians, systemists and software users and also developers will welcome a text that, says the publishers, focusses on the realities within which most software projects have to work. This appears to be useful addition to the literature and is branded as exhibiting the author’s ‘down-to-earth’ approach when he examines how different methods can be worked together for successful results. It is an easy-to-use book that provides ‘an accessible source of Agile techniques’ as well as useful applications." (W. R. Howard, Kybernetes, Vol. 35 (7-8), 2006) \#\#\# From the Back Cover In every software development project there is a need to ensure that the requirements of the user are met without compromising the ultimate goal of the project. However these needs frequently change, and are often erratic. Agile software is a means of putting the software first while at the same time reacting to these user requirements in a flexible and agile way. Agile Software Construction covers the emerging methods and approaches (including extreme programming, feature-driven development and adaptive software development), that are loosely described as "Agile" and shows how to apply them effectively to software development projects. It shows how to plan, organise and develop systems using agile techniques, and highlights some of the problems that may be encountered. There are very few books available that focus on the realities within which most software projects have to work, and most concentrate on one particular method. John Hunt’s down-to-earth approach looking at how the different methods can work together, will be welcomed by a range of readers including software developers, business analysts, development managers, software architects, software engineers and product architects involved with software development, and software professionals needing an accessible source of Agile techniques and applications.}

  note = {Hibernate practically exploded on the Java scene. Why is this open-source tool so popular? Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you. Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself. "Hibernate in Action" carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching. The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day-they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge and insight seep out of every pore of this book. "What's Inside" - ORM concepts - Getting started - Many real-world tasks - The Hibernate application development process \#\#\# About the Author Christian Bauer is a member of the Hibernate developer team. He works as a trainer, consultant, and product manager for Hibernate, EJB 3.0, and JBoss Team at JBoss, a division of Red Hat.

An innovative combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques has the promise of advancing the field of computer vision, which contributes to better understanding of complex real-world applications. The effective usage of machine learning technology in real-world computer vision problems requires understanding the domain of application, abstraction of a learning problem from a given computer vision task, and the selection of appropriate representations for the learnable (input) and learned (internal) entities of the system. In this book, we address all these important aspects from a new perspective: that the key element in the current computer revolution is the use of machine learning to capture the variations in visual appearance, rather than having the designer of the model accomplish this. As a bonus, models learned from large datasets are likely to be more robust and more realistic than the brittle all-design models. \#\#\# Review "This book comes right on time {[}...] It is amazing so early in a new field that a book appears which connects theory to algorithms and through them to convincing applications. {[}...] This book will surely be with us for quite some time to come."

Both a programming language and a specification language, the theory of CSP helps users to understand concurrent systems, and to decide whether a program meets its specification. As a member of the family of process algebras, the concepts of communication and interaction are presented in an algebraic style.An invaluable reference on the state of the art in CSP, Understanding Concurrent Systems also serves as a comprehensive introduction to the field, in addition to providing material for a number of more advanced courses. A first point of reference for anyone wanting to use CSP or learn about its theory, the book also introduces other views of concurrency, using CSP to model and explain these. The text is fully integrated with CSP-based tools such as FDR, and describes how to create new tools based on FDR. Most of the book relies on no theoretical background other than a basic knowledge of sets and sequences. Sophisticated mathematical arguments are avoided whenever possible.Topics and features: presents a comprehensive introduction to CSP; discusses the latest advances in CSP, covering topics of operational semantics, denotational models, finite observation models and infinite-behaviour models, and algebraic semantics; explores the practical application of CSP, including timed modelling, discrete modelling, parameterised verifications and the state explosion problem, and advanced topics in the use of FDR; examines the ability of CSP to describe and enable reasoning about parallel systems modelled in other paradigms; covers a broad variety of concurrent systems, including combinatorial, timed, priority-based, mobile, shared variable, statecharts, buffered and asynchronous systems; contains exercises and case studies to support the text; supplies further tools and information at the associated website: http: //www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ucs/.From undergraduate students of computer science in need of an introduction to the area, to researchers and practitioners desiring a more in-depth understanding of theory and practice of concurrent systems, this broad-ranging text/reference is essential reading for anyone interested in Hoare 's CSP.}

Filled with lively vignettes and cutting-edge research that highlight the intrinsic appeal of microbiology, Bauman's "Mircobiology" Second Edition retains the book's groundbreaking art program, includes a handy new Microbe-at-a-Glance feature, offers new options for the Microbiology Place website/CD-Rom, and provides instructors with a new Media Manager presentation package with 30 multi-step animations. \#\#\# From the Back Cover Two decades ago Benjamin Lewin's *Genes* revolutionized the way we think about and teach molecular biology and molecular genetics. His approach unified the discipline by providing an integrated account of the structure and function of genes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Setting a standard for currency, *Genes* continually embraces emerging trends in this field, such as introducing the molecular aspect of the gene before the traditional analysis of formal genetics. *Genes VIII* continues to innovate; expanding the early discussion of the genome and integrating new information on gene sequencing throughout the text. **New Content** * Human and mouse genome sequence data incorporated throughout * Integrated coverage of recent advances in genomics and gene organization **Updated Content** * DNA replication, repair, and recombination * Transcription and translation * Cancer and signal transduction *Genes VIII* includes access to an innovative Website featuring a complete E-book with Flash illustrations.

(**www.prenhall.com/lewin**) \#\#\# Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. With this eighth edition of GENES, 20 years have passed since the first edition. A novel feature of that first edition was the a presentation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic work in the context of a unified approach. Such an approach has now become commonplace as a result of along string of discoveries showing similarities in solutions to arc'-biological problems that often extend across many or even all species. This new edition has been extensively revised and reorganized. The two most striking driving forces for change have been the sequencing of many genomes, providing information that permeates many sections of the book, and the availability of crystal structures, which in many cases replaces speculations about mechanism with detailed views. A major change in presentation is made possible by the advent of the internet. A continuously updated version of GENES is maintained at www.ergito.com. Aside from some obvious differences in presentation, which allow the reader to customize a variety of views, the web version cites references within the text (compared with at the end of each chapter in the print version), and of course the citations are hyperlinked to original source material wherever possible. A concordance allows readers to find the section of the web site that is equivalent to any print section of the book (or vice versa). A word is in order about the choice of references. With widespread adoption of policies that allow free access to material after a reasonable delay, the advantages to the scientific community for transparency in access have been made abundantly clear. In these circumstances, I do not regard publications in journals that neither adopt this policy nor are widely available (often because they are unreasonably expensive) as legitimate contributions to the scientific literature. I see no point in citing publications to which many readers will not have access. References are cited at the end of each chapter, organized by sections, and are classed into reviews (rev), research articles (ref), and accounts by authors of classic experiments on the ergito web site (exp).}

  note = {Fuzzy sets were for a long time not accepted by the AI community. Now they have become highly evolved and their techniques are well established. This book will teach the reader how to construct a fuzzy expert system to solve real-world problems. After a general discussion of expert systems, the basic fuzzy math required is presented first, requiring little more math background than high-school algebra. This book will fill a void in the market because although there are many books on expert systems, none devote more than a few pages to the notion of fuzzy sets and their applications in this domain. Therefore their use in this book is timely and should be well received. The book is designed as a text and has ample problems with solutions, a solutions manual and an accompanying program on our ftp site. Coverage is accessible to practitioners and academic readers alike. \#\#\# From the Back Cover The most advanced systems that can emulate human thought Fuzzy Expert Systems and Fuzzy Reasoning presents new, cutting-edge theories that enable programmers to emulate human thought processes to solve real-life problems. This text begins with an overview and comparison of current approaches, including rule-based and neural net systems that programmers have developed to solve real-world problems. Next, the authors introduce readers to three key concepts that considerably advance both the power and the speed of conventional expert systems: nonprocedural data-driven languages; fuzzy systems theory (fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets, fuzzy numbers); and a language that allows statements to be executed either sequentially or in parallel, as opposed to conventional one-statement-at-a-time languages that presently dominate programming. While providing a conceptual framework for fuzzy expert systems, the focus is on the development of skills for applications. In addition to the text, readers have access via an FTP site to the fuzzy expert system language FLOPS, which enables them to actually write and debug a fuzzy expert system. Moreover, tutorials and simplified examples help to show how abstract concepts of logic and reasoning are used for problem solving. Special features include: * An introduction to fuzzy mathematics that anyone with an understanding of basic algebra can follow * Question sets with answers accompanying each chapter ensure that readers can apply their new knowledge to develop their own fuzzy expert systems * An FTP site with a complete demonstration version of a fuzzy expert system, Integrated Development Environment Fuzzy Expert Systems and Fuzzy Reasoning, with its expert presentation of both theory and application, is an excellent textbook for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students. In addition, this is essential reading for program designers and researchers in fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, computer science, and artificial intelligence. \#\#\# About the Author WILLIAM SILER, of Southern Dynamic Systems, Inc., is a former academician, having served as chairman of the Biomedical Computer Science program at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, and as professor and chairman of the Biomathematics Department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Unfortunately, existing systems are still too limited in capability for many military purposes. Most large-vocabulary systems use phonemes (individual speech sounds, including vowels and consonants) as recognition units. This research explores the use of diphones (pairings of phonemes) as recognition units. Diphones are acoustically easier to recognize because coarticulation effects between the diphones's phonemes become recognition features, rather than confounding variables as in phoneme recognition. Also, diphones carry more information than phonemes, giving the lexical analyzer two chances to detect every phoneme in the word. Research results confirm these theoretical advantages. In testing with 4490 speech samples from 163 speakers, 70.2\% of 157 test diphones were correctly identified by one trained neural network. In the same tests, the correct diphone was one of the top three outputs 89.0\% of the time. During word recognition tests, the correct word was detected 85\% of the time in continuous speech. Of those detections, the correct diphone was ranked first 41.6\% of the time and among the top six 74\% of the time. In addition, new methods of pitch-based frequency normalization and network feedback-based time alignment are introduced. Both of these techniques improved recognition accuracy on male and female speech samples from all eight dialect regions in the U.S. In one test set, frequency normalization reduced errors by 34\%.}

  note = {Refactoring is about improving the design of existing code. It is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code, yet improves its internal structure. With refactoring you can even take a bad design and rework it into a good one. This book offers a thorough discussion of the principles of refactoring, including where to spot opportunities for refactoring, and how to set up the required tests. There is also a catalog of more than 40 proven refactorings with details as to when and why to use the refactoring, step by step instructions for implementing it, and an example illustrating how it works The book is written using Java as its principle language, but the ideas are applicable to any OO language. \#\#\# Amazon.com Review Your class library works, but could it be better? *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code* shows how *refactoring* can make object-oriented code simpler and easier to maintain. Today refactoring requires considerable design know-how, but once tools become available, all programmers should be able to improve their code using refactoring techniques. Besides an introduction to refactoring, this handbook provides a catalog of dozens of tips for improving code. The best thing about *Refactoring* is its remarkably clear presentation, along with excellent nuts-and-bolts advice, from object expert Martin Fowler. The author is also an authority on software patterns and UML, and this experience helps make this a better book, one that should be immediately accessible to any intermediate or advanced object-oriented developer. (Just like patterns, each refactoring tip is presented with a simple name, a "motivation," and examples using Java and UML.) Early chapters stress the importance of testing in successful refactoring. (When you improve code, you have to test to verify that it still works.) After the discussion on how to detect the "smell" of bad code, readers get to the heart of the book, its catalog of over 70 "refactorings"–tips for better and simpler class design. Each tip is illustrated with "before" and "after" code, along with an explanation. Later chapters provide a quick look at refactoring research. Like software patterns, refactoring may be an idea whose time has come. This groundbreaking title will surely help bring refactoring to the programming mainstream. With its clear advice on a hot new topic, *Refactoring* is sure to be essential reading for anyone who writes or maintains object-oriented software. *–Richard Dragan* **Topics Covered:** Refactoring, improving software code, redesign, design tips, patterns, unit testing, refactoring research, and tools. \#\#\# From the Inside Flap Once upon a time, a consultant made a visit to a development project. The consultant looked at some of the code that had been written; there was a class hierarchy at the center of the system. As he wandered through the hierarchy, the consultant saw that it was rather messy. The higher-level classes made certain assumptions about how the classes would work, assumptions that were embodied in inherited code. That code didn't suit all the subclasses, however, and was overridden quite heavily. If the superclass had been modified a little, then much less overriding would have been necessary. In other places some of the intention of the superclass had not been properly understood, and behavior present in the superclass was duplicated. In yet other places several subclasses did the same thing with code that could clearly be moved up the hierarchy. The consultant recommended to the project management that the code be looked at and cleaned up, but the project management didn't seem enthusiastic. The code seemed to work and there were considerable schedule pressures. The managers said they would get around to it at some later point. The consultant had also shown the programmers who had worked on the hierarchy what was going on. The programmers were keen and saw the problem. They knew that it wasn't really their fault; sometimes a new pair of eyes are needed to spot the problem. So the programmers spent a day or two cleaning up the hierarchy. When they were finished, the programmers had removed half the code in the hierarchy without reducing its functionality. They were pleased with the result and found that it became quicker and easier both to add new classes to the hierarchy and to use the classes in the rest of the system. The project management was not pleased. Schedules were tight and there was a lot of work to do. These two programmers had spent two days doing work that had done nothing to add the many features the system had to deliver in a few months time. The old code had worked just fine. So the design was a bit more "pure" a bit more "clean." The project had to ship code that worked, not code that would please an academic. The consultant suggested that this cleaning up be done on other central parts of the system. Such an activity might halt the project for a week or two. All this activity was devoted to making the code look better, not to making it do anything that it didn't already do. How do you feel about this story? Do you think the consultant was right to suggest further clean up? Or do you follow that old engineering adage, "if it works, don't fix it"? I must admit to some bias here. I was that consultant. Six months later the project failed, in large part because the code was too complex to debug or to tune to acceptable performance. The consultant Kent Beck was brought in to restart the project, an exercise that involved rewriting almost the whole system from scratch. He did several things differently, but one of the most important was to insist on continuous cleaning up of the code using refactoring. The success of this project, and role refactoring played in this success, is what inspired me to write this book, so that I could pass on the knowledge that Kent and others have learned in using refactoring to improve the quality of software. What Is Refactoring? Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs. In essence when you refactor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written. "Improving the design after it has been written." That's an odd turn of phrase. In our current understanding of software development we believe that we design and then we code. A good design comes first, and the coding comes second. Over time the code will be modified, and the integrity of the system, its structure according to that design, gradually fades. The code slowly sinks from engineering to hacking. Refactoring is the opposite of this practice. With refactoring you can take a bad design, chaos even, and rework it into well-designed code. Each step is simple, even simplistic. You move a field from one class to another, pull some code out of a method to make into its own method, and push some code up or down a hierarchy. Yet the cumulative effect of these small changes can radically improve the design. It is the exact reverse of the normal notion of software decay. With refactoring you find the balance of work changes. You find that design, rather than occurring all up front, occurs continuously during development. You learn from building the system how to improve the design. The resulting interaction leads to a program with a design that stays good as development continues. What's in This Book? This book is a guide to refactoring; it is written for a professional programmer. My aim is to show you how to do refactoring in a controlled and efficient manner. You will learn to refactor in such a way that you don't introduce bugs into the code but instead methodically improve the structure. It's traditional to start books with an introduction. Although I agree with that principle, I don't find it easy to introduce refactoring with a generalized discussion or definitions. So I start with an example. Chapter 1 takes a small program with some common design flaws and refactors it into a more acceptable object-oriented program. Along the way we see both the process of refactoring and the application of several useful refactorings. This is the key chapter to read if you want to understand what refactoring really is about. In Chapter 2 I cover more of the general principles of refactoring, some definitions, and the reasons for doing refactoring. I outline some of the problems with refactoring. In Chapter 3 Kent Beck helps me describe how to find bad smells in code and how to clean them up with refactorings. Testing plays a very important role in refactoring, so Chapter 4 describes how to build tests into code with a simple open-source Java testing framework. The heart of the book, the catalog of refactorings, stretches from Chapter 5 through Chapter 12. This is by no means a comprehensive catalog. It is the beginning of such a catalog. It includes the refactorings that I have written down so far in my work in this field. When I want to do something, such as Replace Conditional with Polymorphism (255), the catalog reminds me how to do it in a safe, step-by-step manner. I hope this is the section of the book you'll come back to often. In this book I describe the fruit of a lot of research done by others. The last chapters are guest chapters by some of these people. Chapter 13 is by Bill Opdyke, who describes the issues he has come across in adopting refactoring in commercial development. Chapter 14 is by Don Roberts and John Brant, who describe the true future of refactoring, automated tools. I've left the final word, Chapter 15, to the master of the art, Kent Beck. Refactoring in Java For all of this book I use examples in Java. Refactoring can, of course, be done with other languages, and I hope this book will be useful to those working with other languages. However, I felt it would be best to focus this book on Java because it is the language I know best. I have added occasional notes for refactoring in other languages, but I hope other people will build on this foundation with books aimed at specific languages. To help communicate the ideas best, I have not used particularly complex areas of the Java language. So I've shied away from using inner classes, reflection, threads, and many other of Java's more powerful features. This is because I want to focus on the core refactorings as clearly as I can. I should emphasize that these refactorings are not done with concurrent or distributed programming in mind. Those topics introduce additional concerns that are beyond the scope of this book. Who Should Read This Book? This book is aimed at a professional programmer, someone who writes software for a living. The examples and discussion include a lot of code to read and understand. The examples are all in Java. I chose Java because it is an increasingly well-known language that can be easily understood by anyone with a background in C. It is also an object-oriented language, and object-oriented mechanisms are a great help in refactoring. Although it is focused on the code, refactoring has a large impact on the design of system. It is vital for senior designers and architects to understand the principles of refactoring and to use them in their projects. Refactoring is best introduced by a respected and experienced developer. Such a developer can best understand the principles behind refactoring and adapt those principles to the specific workplace. This is particularly true when you are using a language other than Java, because you have to adapt the examples I've given to other languages. Here's how to get the most from this book without reading all of it. If you want to understand what refactoring is, read Chapter 1; the example should make the process clear. If you want to understand why you should refactor, read the first two chapters. They will tell you what refactoring is and why you should do it. If you want to find where you should refactor, read Chapter 3. It tells you the signs that suggest the need for refactoring. If you want to actually do refactoring, read the first four chapters completely. Then skip-read the catalog. Read enough of the catalog to know roughly what is in there. You don't have to understand all the details. When you actually need to carry out a refactoring, read the refactoring in detail and use it to help you. The catalog is a reference section, so you probably won't want to read it in one go. You should also read the guest chapters, especially Chapter 15. Building on the Foundations Laid by Others I need to say right now, at the beginning, that I owe a big debt with this book, a debt to those whose work over the last decade has developed the field of refactoring. Ideally one of them should have written this book, but I ended up being the one with the time and energy. Two of the leading proponents of refactoring are Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck. They used it as a central part of their development process in the early days and have adapted their development processes to take advantage of it. In particular it was my collaboration with Kent that really showed me the importance of refactoring, an inspiration that led directly to this book. Ralph Johnson leads a group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that is notable for its practical contributions to object technology. Ralph has long been a champion of refactoring, and several of his students have worked on the topic. Bill Opdyke developed the first detailed written work on refactoring in his doctoral thesis. John Brant and Don Roberts have gone beyond writing words into writing a tool, the Refactoring Browser, for refactoring Smalltalk programs. Acknowledgments Even with all that research to draw on, I still needed a lot of help to write this book. First and foremost, Kent Beck was a huge help. The first seeds were planted in a bar in Detroit when Kent told me about a paper he was writing for the Smalltalk Report Beck, hanoi. It not only provided many ideas for me to steal for Chapter 1 but also started me off in taking notes of refactorings. Kent helped in other places too. He came up with the idea of code smells, encouraged me at various sticky points, and generally worked with me to make this book work. I can't help thinking he could have written this book much better himself, but I had the time and can only hope I did the subject justice. As I've written this, I wanted to share much of this expertise directly with you, so I'm very grateful that many of these people have spent some time adding some material to this book. Kent Beck, John Brant, William Opdyke, and Don Roberts have all written or co-written chapters. In addition, Rich Garzaniti and Ron Jeffries have added useful sidebars. Any author will tell you that technical reviewers do a great deal to help in a book like this. As usual, Carter Shanklin and his team at Addison-Wesley put together a great panel of hard-nosed reviewers. These were Ken Auer, Rolemodel Software, Inc. Joshua Bloch, Javasoft John Brant, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Scott Corley, High Voltage Software, Inc. Ward Cunningham, Cunningham \& Cunningham, Inc. Stephane Ducasse Erich Gamma, Object Technology International, Inc. Ron Jeffries Ralph Johnson, University of Illinois Joshua Kerievsky, Industrial Logic, Inc. Doug Lea, SUNY Oswego Sander Tichelaar They all added a great deal to the readability and accuracy of this book, and removed at least some of the errors that can lurk in any manuscript. I'd like to highlight a couple of very visible suggestions that made a difference to the look of the book. Ward and Ron got me to do Chapter 1 in the side-by-side style. Joshua suggested the idea of the code sketches in the catalog. In addition to the official review panel there were many unofficial reviewers. These people looked at the manuscript or the work in progress on my Web pages and made helpful comments. They include Leif Bennett, Michael Feathers, Michael Finney, Neil Galarneau, Hisham Ghazouli, Tony Gould, John Isner, Brian Marick, Ralf Reissing, John Salt, Mark Swanson, Dave Thomas, and Don Wells. I'm sure there are others who I've forgotton; I apologize and offer my thanks. A particularly entertaining review group is the infamous reading group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Because this book reflects so much of their work, I'm particularly grateful for their efforts captured in real audio. This group includes Fredrico "Fred" Balaguer, John Brant, Ian Chai, Brian Foote, Alejandra Garrido, Zhijiang "John" Han, Peter Hatch, Ralph Johnson, Songyu "Raymond" Lu, Dragos-Anton Manolescu, Hiroaki Nakamura, James Overturf, Don Roberts, Chieko Shirai, Les Tyrell, and Joe Yoder. Any good idea needs to be tested in a serious production system. I saw refactoring have a huge effect on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation system (C3). I want to thank all the members of that team: Ann Anderson, Ed Anderi, Ralph Beattie, Kent Beck, David Bryant, Bob Coe, Marie DeArment, Margaret Fronczak, Rich Garzaniti, Dennis Gore, Brian Hacker, Chet Hendrickson, Ron Jeffries, Doug Joppie, David Kim, Paul Kowalsky, Debbie Mueller, Tom Murasky, Richard Nutter, Adrian Pantea, Matt Saigeon, Don Thomas, and Don Wells. Working with them cemented the principles and benefits of refactoring into me on a firsthand basis. Watching their progress as they use refactoring heavily helps me see what refactoring can do when applied to a large project over many years. Again I had the help of J. Carter Shanklin at Addison-Wesley and his team: Krysia Bebick, Susan Cestone, Chuck Dutton, Kristin Erickson, John Fuller, Christopher Guzikowski, Simone Payment, and Genevieve Rajewski. Working with a good publisher is a pleasure; they provided a lot of support and help. Talking of support, the biggest sufferer from a book is always the closest to the author, in this case my (now) wife Cindy. Thanks for loving me even when I was hidden in the study. As much time as I put into this book, I never stopped being distracted by thinking of you.}

Are these discoveries mere "toys" or harbingers of an entirely new worldview? If you were smart and wealthy enough to pursue these issues as your life work, you'd be Stephen Wolfram. And, at the end of your journey, you'd believe you'd found a gateway to an entirely new science – one that will clear away age-old obstacles in fields ranging from cosmology to economics. Wolfram, almost unique among contemporary scientists, has avoided publishing his findings until he could bring them together in a comprehensive treatment for both scientists and nonscientists. A New Kind of Science is that book. Wolfram's lab is his computer (appropriate, since he made his fortune creating Mathematica calculation software for scientific research). Drawing on massive amounts of computer power, he shows that incredible complexity can arise from even the simplest systems and rules. This isn't entirely a new idea. More surprising, perhaps, Wolfram shows that the reverse is true: Order sometimes arises spontaneously out of chaos. Still not quite a revolution, but Wolfram has delved further into complexity than anyone else, identifying guiding principles that appear to have universal application in nature. Scientists, even the most revolutionary, are people of their times. It may be that in 400 years, people will accuse Wolfram of the classic fallacy of "owning a hammer and thinking everything's a nail." But it's also possible that humanity will have 400 years of progress to look back on, thanks in no small part to his work. (Bill Camarda)}

  note = {Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes the use of functions (in contrast to object-oriented programming, which emphasizes the use of objects). It has become popular in recent years because of its simplicity, conciseness, and clarity. This book teaches functional programming as a way of thinking and problem solving, using Haskell, the most popular purely functional language. Rather than using the conventional (boring) mathematical examples commonly found in other programming language textbooks, the author uses examples drawn from multimedia applications, including graphics, animation, and computer music, thus rewarding the reader with working programs for inherently more interesting applications. Aimed at both beginning and advanced programmers, this tutorial begins with a gentle introduction to functional programming and moves rapidly on to more advanced topics. Details about progamming in Haskell are presented in boxes throughout the text so they can be easily found and referred to.}

  date = {1998-05},
  note = {Cryptography, the science of secret writing, is the biggest, baddest security tool in the application programmer's arsenal. Cryptography provides three services that are crucial in secure programming. These include a cryptographic cipher that protects the secrecy of your data; cryptographic certificates, which prove identity (authentication); and digital signatures, which ensure your data has not been damaged or tampered with. This book covers cryptographic programming in Java. Java 1.1 and Java 1.2 provide extensive support for cryptography with an elegant architecture, the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA). Another set of classes, the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), provides additional cryptographic functionality. This book covers the JCA and the JCE from top to bottom, describing the use of the cryptographic classes as well as their innards. The book is designed for moderately experienced Java programmers who want to learn how to build cryptography into their applications. No prior knowledge of cryptography is assumed. The book is peppered with useful examples, ranging from simple demonstrations in the first chapter to full-blown applications in later chapters. Topics include: * The Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) * The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) * Cryptographic providers * The Sun key management tools * Message digests, digital signatures, and certificates (X509v3) * Block and stream ciphers * Implementations of the ElGamal signature and cipher algorithms * A network talk application that encrypts all data sent over the network * An email application that encrypts its messages Covers JDK 1.2 and JCE 1.2. \#\#\# Amazon.com Review Cryptography isn't all there is to security. But rendering information unintelligible to those without the proper key usually plays a big role in any networked data-sharing system. *Java Cryptography* shows the Java programmer (with or without crypto experience) how to implement ciphers, keys, and other data-obscuring techniques in Java. The Java language includes lots of classes that are designed to facilitate cryptography, and this book explores them in depth. Key management classes, random-number generators, signed applets, and other parts of the Java security mechanism get attention in these pages. But most interesting are the author's examples. He has written a complete implementation of the ElGamal cipher as a provider in the framework of the Java Security API. If you want to understand how the Provider Architecture works, this is what you need to examine. Don't look here for an explanation of the mathematics, however. In addition to his discussions and examples for individual pieces of the cryptography infrastructure and his implementation of the ElGamal system, Knudsen includes two nifty crypto-enabled programs: a chat system and an e-mail system. \#\#\# About the Author Jonathan Knudsen is an author at O'Reilly \& Associates.

The authors clearly know their SQL and manage to write about the language in a step-by-step style that progresses smoothly from the simple to the more difficult aspects of the language. The profuse use of examples, each with an accompanying motivation and explanation of the results, lets the reader follow even complex topics without a constant struggle. The authors have even included examples that illustrate common errors programmers make, explaining the right way to perform the task. It doesn't hurt that the sample application is based on something everybody uses every day: food." - Jim Melton, Oracle Corporation "This book's authors recognize the vast majority of work done with a database is data retrieval (rather than storage) and have focused on this area." - Australian Personal Computer, March 2006 \#\#\# Book Description A solid guide and reference to the key elements of SQL and how to use it effectively.}

  note = {The open source PostgreSQL database is soaring in popularity, as thousands of database and web professionals discover its powerful features, transaction support, performance, and industrial-strength scalability. In this book, a founding member of the PostgreSQL development team introduces everything you need to know to succeed with PostgreSQL, from basic SQL commands through database administration and optimization. PostgreSQL assumes no previous database expertise: it establishes a firm foundation of basic concepts and commands before turning to PostgreSQL's advanced, innovative capabilities. Bruce Momjian walks readers step-by-step from their first database queries through the complex queries needed to solve real-world problems. He presents proper query syntax, then explores the value and use of each key SQL commands in working applications. Learn to manipulate and update databases, customize queries, work with SQL aggregates, use joins, combine SELECTs with subqueries, work with triggers and transactions, import and export data, use PostgreSQL query tools, and more. Discover PostgreSQL techniques for server-side programming and multi-user control, and master PostgreSQL's interfaces to C, C++, ODBC, JDBC, Perl, and Tcl/TK. You'll also find detailed coverage of PostgreSQL administration, including backups, troubleshooting, and access configuration. \#\#\# From the Inside Flap This book is about POSTGRESQL, the most advanced open source database. From its origins in academia, POSTGRESQL has moved to the Internet with explosive growth. It is hard to believe the advances during the past four years under the guidance of a team of worldwide Internet developers. This book is a testament to their vision, and to the success that POSTGRESQL has become. The book is designed to lead the reader from their first database query through the complex queries needed to solve real-world problems. No knowledge of database theory or practice is required. However, basic knowledge of operating system capabilities is expected, such as the ability to type at an operating system prompt. Beginning with a short history of POSTGRESQL, the book moves from simple queries to the most important database commands. Common problems are covered early, which should prevent users from getting stuck with queries that fail. The author has seen many bug reports in the past few years and consequently has attempted to warn readers about the common pitfalls. With a firm foundation established, additional commands are introduced. The later chapters outline complex topics like transactions and performance. At each step, the purpose of each command is clearly illustrated. The goal is to have readers understand more than query syntax. They should know why each command is valuable, so they can use the proper commands in their real-world database applications. A database novice should read the entire book, while skimming over the later chapters. The complex nature of database systems should not prevent readers from getting started. Test databases offer a safe way to try queries. As readers gain experience, later chapters will begin to make more sense. Experienced database users can skip the early chapters on basic SQL functionality. The cross-referencing of sections allows you to quickly move from general to more specific information. Much information has been moved out of the main body of the book into appendices. Appendix A lists sources of additional information about POSTGRESQL.Appendix B provides information about installing POSTGRESQL. Appendix C lists the features of POSTGRESQL not found in other database systems. Appendix D contains a copy of the POSTGRESQL manual pages which should be consulted anytime you have trouble with query syntax. Also, do not overlook the excellent documentation that is part of POSTGRESQL. This documentation covers many complex topics, including much POSTGRESQL-specific functionality that cannot be covered in a book of this length. Sections of the documentation are referenced in this book where appropriate. This book uses italics for identifiers, SMALLCAPS for SQL keywords, and a monospaced font for SQL queries. The Web site for this book is located at postgresql/docs/awbook.html. 0201703319P04062001 \#\#\# From the Back Cover The most advanced, feature-rich SQL database server available, the open-source PostgreSQL system has rapidly become a key Internet technology. **PostgreSQL: Introduction and Concepts**, written by a founding member of the PostgreSQL Global Development Team, provides a much-needed tutorial and real-world guide to understanding and working with this complex yet essential system. Assuming no previous knowledge of database systems, the book establishes a firm foundation of basic concepts and commands before turning to PostgreSQL's more advanced and innovative capabilities. It leads you step-by-step from your first database query through the complex queries needed to solve real-world database problems. The author not only presents proper query syntax, he goes beyond the mechanics to explore the value and use of these commands in working database applications. You will read about such important topics as: * Basic SQL commands for manipulating and updating a database * Customizing queries * SQL aggregates * Joining tables * Combining SELECTs and subqueries * Transactions * Performance * Importing and exporting data * Database query tools, including PSQL and PGACCESS * PostgreSQL interfaces to C, C++, ODBC, JDBC, Perl, TCL/TK, and more * Server-side programming and multi-user control * Extending PostgreSQL with C * PostgreSQL administration, including backups, troubleshooting, and access configuration * Features unique to PostgreSQL Throughout, the author highlights common pitfalls, offers tips to save you time and trouble, and provides many examples–all garnered from his extensive experience and inside knowledge. In addition, this resource-rich guide provides a copy of the official PostgreSQL reference manual. A companion web site, www.postgresql.org/docs/awbook.html, will contain updates, corrections, and links to other material. 0201703319B04062001}

  note = {With the advent of `multimedia', digital signal processing (DSP) of sound has emerged from the shadow of bandwidth limited speech processing to become a research field of its own. To date, most research in DSP applied to sound has been concentrated on speech, which is bandwidth limited to about 4 kilohertz. Speech processing is also limited by the low fidelity typically expected in the telephone network. Today, the main applications of audio DSP are high quality audio coding and the digital generation and manipulation of music signals. They share common research topics including perceptual measurement techniques and analysis/synthesis methods. Additional important topics are hearing aids using signal processing technology and hardware architectures for digital signal processing of audio. In all these areas the last decade has seen a significant amount of application-oriented research. The frequency range of wideband audio has an upper limit of 20 kilohertz and the resulting difference in frequency range and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) due to sample size must be taken into account when designing DSP algorithms. There are whole classes of algorithms that the speech community is not interested in pursuing or using. These algorithms and techniques are revealed in this book. This book is suitable for advanced level courses and serves as a valuable reference for researchers in the field. Interested and informed engineers will also find the book useful in their work. \#\#\# Review `The book is a must-have for everyone involved in digital audio research and development.'

All this without the user having to know or specify the form or structure of solutions in advance.

The third edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does. \#\#\# About the Author received a degree in mathematics in 1992 and a Ph.D. in computer science (University of Rome, "La Sapienza") in 1995.

Tracking and Kalman Filtering Made Easy emphasizes the physical and geometric aspects of radar filters as well as the beauty and simplicity of their mathematics. An abundance of design equations, procedures, and curves allows readers to design tracking filters quickly and test their performance using only a pocket calculator The text incorporates problems and solutions, figures and photographs, and astonishingly simple derivations for various filters. It tackles problems involving clutter returns, redundant target detections, inconsistent data, track-start and track-drop rules, data association, matched filtering, tracking with chirp waveform, and more. The book also covers useful techniques such as the moving target detector (MTD) clutter rejection technique. All explanations are given in clear and simple terms, including: * The voltage-processing approach to least-squares filtering * The correlation between such procedures as discrete orthogonal Legendre polynomial (DOLP) and voltage processing * The mathematical sameness of tracking and estimation problems on the one hand, and sidelobe canceling and adaptive array processing on the other * The massively parallel systolic array sidelobe canceler processor * Important computational accuracy issues * An appended comparison between the Kalman and the Swerling filters, written by Dr. Peter Swerling Tracking and Kalman Filtering Made Easy is invaluable for engineers, scientists, and mathematicians involved in tracking filter design. Its straightforward approach makes it an excellent textbook for senior-undergraduate and first-year graduate courses.}
